every

They
be
in

about
Occasionally

Guo
Jingming
said
my
friends
are
my
courage
to
live
and
they
give
me
your
ability
let
me
face
this
world
no
longer
panic
Those
who
have
and
be
crazy
with
me
with
sadness
with
cycling
through
the
thin
youth
friend
I
think
we
all
remember
the
youth
is
how
we
face
cannot
erase
the
traces
Xiao
chen
went
to
Hainan
in
a
dessert
shop
as
dessert
Whenever
we
have
a
vacation
will
be
received
her
phone
call
she
received
the
text
message
she
always
likes
to
write
very
long
As
it
was
she
knew
I
was
a
very
insecure
afraid
to
lose
even
if
there
is
no
important
will
also
write
a
long
message
let
me
know
her
by
my
side
never
leave
Chen
is
a
very
clever
girl
but
in
the
study
does
not
enlighten
after
each
test
there
will
always
be
that
her
poor
grades
in
my
front
side
into
my
mouth
ice
cream
a
begged
me
to
help
her
with
We
have
been
together
for
9
years
so
only
a
piece
of
memory
I
always
thought
she
was
a
bright
child
happy
and
simple
life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
From
the
bright
sunlight
If
the
rain
from
the
cloud
Break
your
pride
Think
of
my
love
for
you
And
everything
shall
be
fine
Let
us
soar
let
us
fly
To
the
highest
height
And
everything
shall
be
fineLast
year
the
cancer
nearly
finished
me
off
However
with
the
accompaniment
of
my
best
friend
Candice
I
could
eventually
get
through
these
tough
time
Sometimes
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
always
stand
by
my
side
Last
summer
the
doctor
discovered
that
I
suffered
from
lung
cancer
At
that
moment
I
was
completely
shocked
All
memories
that
I
have
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
in
seconds
I
thought
I
was
going
to
leave
all
my
friends
my
family
and
all
people
I
loved
To
me
the
whole
world
was
just
sinking
Luckily
that
was
just
in
an
early
stage
and
the
doctor
said
that
I
had
I
great
chance
to
recover
after
a
series
of
treatments
But
he
warned
me
that
the
treatment
would
be
very
tough
and
painful
At
first
I
have
considered
to
refuse
the
treatment
However
after
I
have
though
about
all
of
my
valuable
friends
and
my
mom
and
dad
I
chose
to
take
the
chance
During
the
treatment
I
gradually
suffered
from
the
side
effects
The
number
of
hairs
on
my
head
declined
and
I
vomited
from
dawn
till
night
on
every
single
day
I
had
a
very
poor
appetite
and
I
nearly
had
no
desired
to
put
any
food
to
my
mouth
I
was
very
painful
and
I
was
thinking
about
giving
up
the
treatment
I
though
I
could
not
tolerate
it
anymore
However
with
the
support
and
encouragement
from
my
best
friend
Candice
I
have
eventually
made
it
through
the
rain
and
stand
up
once
again
Finally
I
recovered
One
summer
night
Candice
came
to
the
hospital
to
visit
me
We
sat
on
the
bench
that
facing
the
sea
The
sun
was
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
night
descended
We
chatted
underneath
the
stars
We
have
not
met
each
other
since
the
graduation
Candice
said
with
tears
on
her
face
Yes
I
have
never
thought
we
would
have
the
reunion
in
the
situation
I
said
She
kept
silent
with
her
tears
in
the
warm
gentle
breeze
We
have
been
best
friends
since
we
were
small
I
do
not
want
this
friendship
to
end
up
so
soon
She
cried
desperately
Zach
you
are
a
man
You
are
a
man
who
is
courageous
and
adventurous
You
should
have
that
guts
to
fight
for
your
life
and
people
around
you
But
Now
I
am
going
to
give
you
the
courage
you
need
She
lay
her
hand
on
me
Lord
please
give
this
little
boy
love
and
hope
to
face
the
obstacle
that
he
is
now
facing
Please
give
him
courage
to
help
him
to
find
the
way
Now
you
have
already
possessed
the
ability
to
fight
this
war
You
should
never
give
up
as
there
is
a
light
in
your
heart
and
shines
very
brightly
Since
them
I
understand
that
when
fate
is
tough
just
toughen
your
faith
With
a
smile
I
know
I
could
face
the
future
no
matter
what
lay
ahead
And
there's
a
hero
comes
along
with
the
strength
to
carry
on
My
dad
has
always
used
this
song
to
encourage
me
Until
he
passed
away
I
still
keep
this
song
in
my
iPod
and
listen
to
it
when
I
need
to
get
through
some
tough
time
To
me
this
song
does
not
only
symbolize
the
spirit
of
my
dad
but
also
mine
This
song
is
ubiquitous
in
various
singing
competitions
Regardless
of
its
singing
technique
the
beautiful
melody
and
those
meaningful
lyrics
has
