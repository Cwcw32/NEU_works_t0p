helped
many
people
to
get
through
obstacles
This
fabulous
song
was
composed
by
American
singer-songwriter
Mariah
Carey
in
1993
and
definitely
performed
by
herself
The
song
mentioned
that
among
every
single
one
of
us
a
hero
lies
inside
our
heart
If
we
try
to
reach
into
our
soul
our
emptiness
will
disappear
There's
a
hero
if
you
look
inside
your
heart
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid
of
who
you
are
When
I
was
small
I
was
a
child
who
was
so
fragile
and
cried
easily
I
was
afraid
of
everything
I
was
so
this
and
small
and
when
my
classmates
bullied
me
all
I
would
do
was
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
and
cry
from
dawn
till
night
Worse
still
I
was
poor
in
academic
result
and
no
teachers
loved
me
On
these
days
I
found
myself
useless
and
believed
that
no
one
in
this
world
would
recognise
this
small
potato
I
was
so
desperate
Yet
in
one
dark
night
my
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
hand
was
so
large
and
warm
All
I
could
feel
was
the
love
and
hope
transmitted
through
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
and
to
my
heart
and
soul
Son
you
should
not
be
fragile
anymore
But
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
Now
I
am
going
to
recall
your
hero
from
your
soul
and
from
now
on
you
would
never
feel
lonely
anymore
My
hero
and
your
hero
have
already
stayed
together
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
Other
people
can
say
anything
they
want
to
say
Although
they
try
to
bring
you
down
you
will
never
allow
them
to
do
so
because
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
This
hero
will
always
stay
close
to
you
and
protect
you
forever
Afterwards
he
sang
this
song
to
me
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow
But
don't
let
anyone
to
tear
them
away
Since
then
whenever
I
need
to
face
any
problems
or
obstacles
alone
I
will
not
be
fragile
anymore
All
I
need
to
do
is
sing
Hero
along
with
my
hero
and
my
father's
hero
and
I
will
certainly
know
that
my
father
will
guide
me
where
I
should
go
I
know
that
there
is
a
light
in
me
and
shines
very
brightly
and
other
people
can
try
but
they
can
never
take
that
away
from
me
The
meeting
is
WangHai
Time
always
unknowingly
hurried
away
flash
Also
in
the
online
to
spend
a
few
years
Cry
also
laughed
Thousands
of
day
and
night
WangHai
roaming
A
thought
to
mature
Walk
to
the
friend
go
to
How
many
friends
already
not
disappear
Sitting
alone
in
the
space
is
cold
and
cheerless
Some
vague
sad
loss
Thankfully
Have
a
lot
of
friends
have
been
silent
about
Accompany
me
along
the
way
Always
buchibuqi
In
the
virtual
network
Deduce
true
feelings
Behind
the
screen
in
the
cold
And
each
wish
Whenever
the
birthday
Will
receive
blessings
of
friends
Very
often
I
moved
ShiXi
unceasingly
Thanks
friends
gifts
and
blessing
Because
of
you
Lonely
night
has
not
lonely
Because
of
you
My
birthday
is
not
cold
and
cheerless
Of
a
friend
said
I
am
not
alone
My
friend
Thousands
of
WanLiLi
just
a
moment
of
distance
Don't
need
name
also
need
not
face
Both
you
and
I

just
to
pay
tribute
and
show
appreciation
to

person
called
mom
though
some
may
not
say
it
openly
to
their
mother
There's
no
substitute
for
her
Cherish
every
single
moment
Though
at
times
she
may
not
be
the
best
of
friends
may
not
agree
to
our
thoughts
she
is
still
your
mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left
