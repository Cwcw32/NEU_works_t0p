Mandela
has
a
history
of
lung
problems
dating
back
to
when
he
contracted
tuberculosis
while
in
jail
as
a
political
prisoner
He
spent
27
years
in
prison
including
18
years
on
the
windswept
Robben
Island
off
Cape
Town
The
former
president
was
admitted
to
a
Pretoria
hospital
on
December
8
and
this
was
his
longest
stay
in
hospital
since
he
was
released
from
prison
in
1990
Current
President
Jacob
Zuma
visited
Mandela
on
Christmas
Day
and
said
the
former
South
African
leader
was
doing
much
better
making
progress
and
in
good
spirits
Mandela
was
also
admitted
to
hospital
in
February
because
of
abdominal
pain
but
released
the
following
day
after
a
keyhole
examination
showed
there
was
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
him
He
has
spent
most
of
his
time
since
then
in
another
home
in
Qunu
his
ancestral
village
in
the
impoverished
Eastern
Cape
province
His
poor
health
has
prevented
him
from
making
any
public
appearances
in
the
past
two
years
although
he
has
continued
to
receive
high-profile
visitors
including
former
US
President
Bill
Clinton
earlier
this
year
Mandela
became
South
Africa's
first
black
president
after
the
country's
first
all-race
elections
in
1994
After
his
release
from
prison
he
used
his
popularity
to
push
for
reconciliation
between
whites
and
blacks
which
became
the
bedrock
of
the
post-apartheid
Rainbow
Nation
Mandela
stepped
down
as
president
in
1999
after
one
term
in
office
and
has
largely
been
absent
from
public
life
for
the
last
decade.Abu
Adnan
smirked
from
behind
his
black
balaclava
his
auburn
whiskers
peeking
through
the
fabric
as
the
corners
of
his
mouth
rose
A
religious
scholar
and
Shari¡®a
law
official
in
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
leadership
in
the
Aleppo
area
the
35-year-old
had
a
ready
answer
for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We
know
the
West
and
its
oppressive
ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N
Security
Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity
Smokers
need
not
apply
A
potential
recruit
must
undertake
a
10-day
religious-training
course
to
ascertain
his
understanding
of
religion
his
morals
his
reputation
A
15-to-20-day
military-training
program
follows
That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
the
vehicle
including
Abu
Adnan
who
silently
approached
the
car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not
introduce
himself
until
I
asked
who
he
was
later
We
drove
to
a
small
cold
concrete
room
with
a
tiny
window
that
barely
let
in
any
light
from
an
already
overcast
sky
We
sat
among
boxes
of
long-life
milk
and
bags
of
blankets
and
winter
clothes
waiting
to
be
distributed
Our
host
the
driver
tried
to
start
a
portable
gas
heater
but
there
was
no
gas
America
has
called
us
terrorists
because
it
says
that
some
of
our
tactics
bear
the
fingerprints
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community

to
Abu
Adnan
