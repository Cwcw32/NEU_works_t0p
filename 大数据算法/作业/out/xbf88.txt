story
with
in
the
hope
that
you
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
While
our
loved
ones
must
have
the
money
we
make
to
live
it
is
the
love
we
have
that
they
really
want
Give
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
It
is
not
easy
to
define
what
kind
of
meaning
to
the
enterprise
culture
because
the
enterpise
culture
stems
from
the
ration
and
reality
which
should
be
related
to
the
regulations
or
how
to
react
to
the
risk
of
management
or
market
instead
of
just
focusing
on
training
and
meeting
which
should
be
related
to
the
proportion
of
thoughts
of
belonging
to
our
company
and
benefitting
our
company
in
the
difficulty
Sometimes
the
puzzled
people
are
always
in
the
mess
of
understanding
of
why
the
itemized
regulations
could
not
optimize
the
operation
and
not
regulate
the
action
of
some
officials
who
always
abused
the
power
to
benefit
themselves
which
lead
to
the
argument
that
as
long
as
the
company
is
so
large
that
the
culture
of
enterprise
is
absolutly
difficult
to
be
built
up
Different
people
with
different
education
background
and
different
comprehension
of
society
would
not
be
integrated
to
the
common
recognition
of
enterprise
culture
which
is
the
crux
to
help
the
company
be
prosperous
In
spite
of
training
many
officials
there
are
lots
of
bottlenecks
which
should
be
smoothed
and
holes
which
should
be
covered
so
we
must
work
out
some
measures
to
make
our
company
step
on
the
right
road
Regulations
are
parts
of
the
enterprise
culture
making
the
road
straight
but
what
kind
of
regulations
are
suitful
to
the
state-owned
company
The
regulation
are
always
eroded
by
dereliction
and
are
not
always
strickly
implemented
by
some
departments
Frankly
speaking
the
enterprise
culture
is
just
having
some
aspects
in
consciousness
frequently
dominating
the
behavior
which
would
give
us
some
reference
on
how
to
enact
the
detailed
regulations
could
get
the
return
as
expected
The
most
important
thing
related
to
the
enterprise
culture
is
how
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
in
the
every
respect
of
operation
We
must
detail
every
process
of
how
to
control
the
cost
and
how
to
make
the
work
efficient
and
rational
If
employee
could
make
their
regulations
rooted
in
mind
they
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
keep
them
from
dereliction
and
would
try
their
best
to
devote
the
wisdom
to
benifitting
our
company.For
example
The
flaws
in
human
nature
and
the
shortage
of
wealth
would
seduce
the
officals
to
accept
the
secret
money
from
agencies
who
are
intended
to
pull
down
the
officals
by
all
kinds
of
tactics
and
if
the
officals
are
too
fragile
to
resist
the
gifts
they
would
be
united
with
agencies
to
cheat
our
company
so
the
task
which
brooks
no
delay
is
the
education
brainwashing
and
making
the
severe
punishment
happen
without
them
the
enterprise
culture
is
like
the
moon
in
water
like
the
flowers
in
mist
like
the
stupid
being
called
clever
What
is
the
quintessence
of
the
enterprise
culture
It
is
easy
or
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
conclusion
because
it
is
a
hard
job
to
change
people¡¯s
mindset
which
is
always
in
the
prejustice.So
at
first
we
must
scrutinize
the
origin
of
the
prejustice
why
are
so
many
people
always
just
negating
others
because
we
are
extremely
lack
of
communication
to
understand
with
each
other
lacking
of
wisdom
to
tell
the
right
and
the
wrong
lacking
of
the
wide
chest
to
tolerate
the
different
ideas
wnich
lead
to
misunderstand
among
people
and
to
form
the
impasse
to
flexibly
resolve
the
thorny
problem.There
are
some
words
similar
and
implicated
with
the
word
culture
in
dictionary
such
as
communication
concoct
cooperation
coordination
copartner
control¡±
giving
us
some
metaphor
or
euphemism
that
enterprise
culture
must
depend
on
the
communication
cooperation
must
control
the
ridiculous
behavior
of
some
officials
must
concoct
the
atmosphere
from
stiff
suffocated
environment
to
the
active
creative
philosophical
philanthropic
state
of
mindset
of
everyone.But
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
behavior
spontaneously
follow
the
bright
side
of
human
being
just
because
of
the
fragile
and
selfish
nature
of
people
with
some
ignorant
knowledge
about
themselves
so
using
the
regulations
to
control
the
devil
in
their
mindset
and
encouraging
the
bold
attitude
to
resolve
the
present
and
history
problem
is
the
essential
way
of
making
the
enterprise
culture
alive
and
giving
the
light
to
the
employee
We
must
change
the
thoughts
that
we
are
isolated
by
others
we
are
just
living
for
ourself
we
are
just
focusing
on
our
private
cases
to
the
thoughts
that
if
we
can
help
each
other
if
we
believe
in
the
philosophy
of
strengthenning
the
consciousness
of
doing
the
job
positively
and
wisely
getting
good
return
we
can
achieve
the
goal
of
making
our
company
profitful
and
competitive
even
making
our
life
happy
Why
are
the
employee
always
having
no
enthusiasm
and
lacking
of
a
little
responsibility
in
their
job?why
are
there
lots
of
complaint
in
our
company?why
are
the
talented
people
resigning
quickly
from
our
company?Yes
the
salary
is
the
key
and
having
no
feeling
in
cooperation
unity
belonging
and
having
not
the
promising
future
are
the
fundamental
reasons
which
steamrollerred
the
spirit
to
be
loyal
to
company
so
putting
the
importance
of
employee
in
priority
is
the
way
of
having
the
high
competition
in
this
globallized
world
A
healthy
company
is
the
one
that
urgently
need
the
creative
advices
from
employee
in
stead
of
closing
their
eyes
filling
in
their
ears
in
front
of
the
employee
who
may
have
some
profound
and
pragmatic
ideas
which
maybe
benifit
to
the
operation
of
our
company.But
how
to
distinguish
the
good
ideas
or
the
wrong
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
leaders
who
must
look
through
everything
including
themselves
and
others
adding
that
they
must
comprehend
the
logic
of
mindset
and
behavior
of
themself
To
be
leaders
the
open
attitude
is
the
good
way
to
rationalize
the
management
adopting
the
positive
way
to
eliminate
the
flaws
in
the
structure
and
to
attain
the
goal
with
attacking
the
black
hands¡±
instead
of
always
being
in
defensive
measure
of
healing
the
fissure
in
management
that
is
deficient
in
courage
and
wisdom.It
is
also
one
part
of
the
enterprise
culture.Frankly
saying
having
good
return
to
our
company
is
dominated
by
the
fate
by
the
hearts
of
all
employee
by
the
regulations
by
the
rational
philosophy
by
the
authentic
wisdom
Service
is
the
culture
it
sounds
like
simple
but
complicated
and
profound
if
you
want
to
make
it
better
and
better
How
to
do
service
is
the
important
culture
of
enterprise
which
could
attract
many
people
to
take
our
flights
again
and
again.We
can
ask
a
simple
question
that
if
you
look
up
to
see
the
twinkled
stars
in
night
what
make
you
comfortable?The
answer
is
easy
the
bright
the
color
make
you
feel
comfortable
which
can
make
us
have
some
comprehension
that
if
you
make
people¡¯s
body
such
as
eye
ear
limbs
nose
heart
feel
nice
your
service
is
the
nice
service
if
you
make
the
customers
angry
you
failed
in
doing
service.So
you
must
think
over
how
to
make
the
customers
feel
better
is
the
best
way
to
learn
how
to
give
service
to
these
arrogant
and
hypercritical
customers
Above
all
We
can
understand
that
if
you
have
regulations
in
your
mindset
which
sometimes
is
selfish
and
Out
of
my
window
the
darkness
gave
me
a
signal:if
you
are
habitted
in
the
darkness
of
heart
you
would
be
dissappionted
for
ever.sometimes
I
want
to
find
the
way
of
making
me
in
the
positive
attitude
to
the
life
but
always
are
beated
by
my
experiences
which
cutted
off
the
robe
attached
to
the
sunshine.but
the
frustrated
happenning
is
not
the
domination
which
converts
my
good
intention
to
the
devil
the
domination
is
my
thoughts
which
are
sometimes
not
superficial
but
profound
gives
me
the
light
and
warm
to
live
simply
and
happily
What
kind
of
thoughts
would
release
my
pressure
and
gives
me
the
ability
to
survive
in
the
chilly
and
choppy
reality
which
would
distort
the
heart
fragile
to
the
fragmentary
condition
or
make
the
heart
wisom
strong
get
the
meaning
of
life
which
would
push
me
to
the
heaven
with
lots
of
beauty
and
full
I
would
say
that
my
thoughts
is
related
to
the
thoughts
themselves
if
you
can
change
the
thoughts
quickly
and
correctedly
you
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
pusure
the
objects
you
want;if
you
are
stubborn
enough
you
would
be
easily
defeated
by
the
fate
which
urgently
need
the
wisdom
light
to
cover
the
black
in
the
mindset
full
of
good
and
evil
When
I
was
a
child
I
do
not
know
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
and
have
no
faith
which
would
comfort
my
soul
to
give
me
a
light
would
direct
my
road
to
the
tranquillized
home
My
pressure
is
from
my
family
where
my
father
is
not
a
reasonable
person
and
had
no
ideas
on
how
to
cultivate
my
individual
personality
and
my
character
so
in
the
long
time
I
felt
the
life
of
mine
is
in
hell
even
if
I
have
food
to
eat
have
cloth
to
wear
but
my
heart
was
in
deep
frustration
and
had
much
hatre
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
shaping
my
thoughts
that
the
life
had
not
power
to
lift
me
from
the
miserable
conditions.after
long
long
time
the
climate
has
been
changed
to
more
warm
the
rivers
have
been
changed
