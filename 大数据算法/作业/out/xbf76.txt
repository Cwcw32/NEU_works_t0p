being
on
the
phone
all
night
When
you
were
18
she
cried
at
your
high
school
graduation
You
thanked
her
by
staying
out
partying
until
dawn
Growing
Old
and
Gray
When
you
were
19
she
paid
your
college
tuition
drove
you
to
campus
carried
your
bags
You
thanked
her
by
saying
good-bye
outside
the
dorm
so
you
wouldn't
be
embarrassed
in
front
of
your
friends
When
you
were
20
she
asked
whether
you
were
seeing
anyone
You
thanked
her
by
saying
It's
none
of
your
business
When
you
were
21
she
suggested
certain
careers
for
your
future
You
thanked
her
by
saying
I
don't
want
to
be
like
you
When
you
were
22
she
hugged
you
at
your
college
graduation
You
thanked
her
by
asking
whether
she
could
pay
for
a
trip
to
Europe
When
you
were
23
she
gave
you
furniture
for
your
first
apartment
You
thanked
her
by
telling
your
friends
it
was
ugly
When
you
were
24
she
met
your
fiance10
and
asked
about
your
plans
for
the
future
You
thanked
her
by
glaring
and
growling
Muuhh-ther
please
When
you
were
25
she
helped
to
pay
for
your
wedding
and
she
cried
and
told
you
how
deeply
she
loved
you
You
thanked
her
by
moving
halfway
across
the
country
When
you
were
30
she
called
with
some
advice
on
the
baby
You
thanked
her
by
telling
her
Things
are
different
now
When
you
were
40
she
called
to
remind
you
of
a
relative's
birthday
You
thanked
her
by
saying
you
were
really
busy
right
now
When
you
were
50
she
fell
ill
and
needed
you
to
take
care
of
her
You
thanked
her
by
reading
about
the
burden
parents
become
to
their
children
And
then
one
day
she
quietly
died
And
everything
you
never
did
came
crashing
down
like
thunder
Rock
me
baby
rock
me
all
night
long
The
hand
who
rocks
the
cradle...may
rock
the
world
Let
us
take
a
moment
of
the
time
just
to
pay
tribute
and
show
appreciation
to
the
person
called
mom
though
some
may
not
say
it
openly
to
their
mother
There's
no
substitute
for
her
Cherish
every
single
moment
Though
at
times
she
may
not
be
the
best
of
friends
may
not
agree
to
our
thoughts
she
is
still
your
mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left
Thomas
Carlyle
lived
from
1795
until
1881
He
was
a
10000
wow
gold
Scot
essayist
and
historian
During
his
lifetime
he
became
one
of
the
world's
greatest
writers
But
he
was
a
human
and
storage
rack

On
October

1826
wow

Carlyle
married
his
secretary
Jane
Welsh
She
was
an
intelligent
attractive
and
somewhat
temperamental
daughter
of
a
well-to-do
doctor
They
had
their
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
but
still
loved
Bathroom
Vanities
each
other
dearly
After
their
marriage
Jane
continued
to
serve
as
his
secretary
But
after
several
years
of
marriage
Jane
became
ill
Being
Bathroom
Mirrors
a
hard
worker
Carlyle
became
so
absorbed
in
his
writings
that
he
let
Jane
continue
working
for
several
weeks
after
she
became
ill
She
had
cancer
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
slow
growing
kind
she
finally
became
confined
to
her
bed
Although
Carlyle
loved
her
Bathroom
Accessories
dearly
he
very
seldom
found
time
to
stay
with
her
long
He
was
busy
with
his
work
when
Jane
died
they
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
for
the
service
The
day
Glass
Basin
was
a
miserable
day
It
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
Following
the
funeral
Carlyle
went
back
to
his
home
He
was
taking
it
pretty
hard
He
went
up
the
stairs
to
Jane's
room
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
her
bed
He
sat
there
thinking
Shower
Enclosures
about
how
little
time
he
had
spent
with
her
and
wishing
so
much
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
differently
Noticing
her
diary
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
picked
it
up
and
began
to
steel
shelving
read
it
Suddenly
he
seemed
shocked
He
saw
it
There
on
one
page
she
had
written
Interior
Doors
a
single
line
Yesterday
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
and
it
was
like
heaven
I
love
him
so
Something
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
He
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
that
he
meant
so
much
to
her
He
thought
of
all
wow
gold
australia
the
times
he
had
gone
about
his
work
without
thinking
about
and
noticing
her
Then
Carlyle
turned
the
page
in
the
diary
There
he
noticed
she
racking
had
written
some
words
that
broke
his
heart
I
have
listened
all
day
to
hear
his
steps
in
the
hall
but
now
it
is
late
and
I
guess
he
won't
come
today
Carlyle
read
a
little
more
in
the
book
Then
he
threw
it
down
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Some
of
his
friends
found
him
at
the
grave
his
buy
wow
gold
australia
face
buried
in
the
mud
His
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
Tears
continued
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
He
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
If
I
had
only
known
if
I
had
only
known
But
it
was
too
late
for
Carlyle
She
was
dead
After
Jane's
death
Carlyle
made
world
of
warcraft
gold
for
sale
little
attempt
to
write
again
The
historians
say
he
lived
another
15
years
weary
bored
and
a
partial
recluse
I
share
the
story
with
in
the
hope
that
you
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
While
our
loved
ones
must
have
the
money
we
make
to
live
it
is
the
love
we
have
that
they
really
want
Give
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
It
is
not
easy
to
define
what
kind
of
meaning
to
the
enterprise
culture
because
the
enterpise
culture
stems
from
the
ration
and
reality
which
should
be
related
to
the
regulations
or
how
to
react
to
the
risk
of
management
or
market
instead
of
just
focusing
on
training
and
meeting
which
should
be
related
to
the
proportion
of
thoughts
of
belonging
to
our
company
and
benefitting
our
company
in
the
difficulty
Sometimes
the
puzzled
people
are
always
in
the
mess
of
understanding
of
why
the
itemized
regulations
could
not
optimize
the
operation
and
not
regulate
the
action
of
some
officials
who
always
abused
the
power
to
benefit
themselves
which
lead
to
the
argument
that
as
long
as
the
company
is
so
large
that
the
culture
of
enterprise
is
absolutly
difficult
to
be
built
up
Different
people
with
different
education
background
and
different
comprehension
of
society
would
not
be
integrated
to
the
common
recognition
of
enterprise
culture
which
is
the
crux
to
help
the
company
be
prosperous
In
spite
of
training
many
officials
there
are
lots
of
bottlenecks
which
should
be
smoothed
and
holes
which
should
be
covered
so
we
must
work
out
some
measures
to
make
our
company
step
on
the
right
road
Regulations
are
parts
of
the
enterprise
culture
making
the
road
straight
but
what
kind
of
regulations
are
suitful
to
the
state-owned
company
The
regulation
are
always
eroded
by
dereliction
and
are
not
always
strickly
implemented
by
some
departments
Frankly
speaking
the
enterprise
culture
is
just
having
some
aspects
in
consciousness
frequently
dominating
the
behavior
which
would
give
us
some
reference
on
how
to
enact
the
detailed
regulations
could
get
the
return
as
expected
The
most
important
thing
related
to
the
enterprise
culture
is
how
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
in
the
every
respect
of
operation
We
must
detail
every
process
of
how
to
control
the
cost
and
how
to
make
the
work
efficient
and
rational
If
employee
could
make
their
regulations
rooted
in
mind
they
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
keep
them
from
dereliction
and
would
try
their
best
to
devote
the
wisdom
to
benifitting
our
company.For
example
The
flaws
in
human
nature
and
the
shortage
of
wealth
would
seduce
the
officals
to
accept
the
secret
money
from
agencies
who
are
intended
to
pull
down
the
officals
by
all
kinds
of
tactics
and
if
the
officals
are
too
fragile
to
resist
the
gifts
they
would
be
united
with
agencies
to
cheat
our
company
so
the
task
which
brooks
no
delay
is
the
education
brainwashing
and
making
the
severe
punishment
happen
without
them
the
enterprise
culture
is
like
the
moon
in
water
like
the
flowers
in
mist
like
the
stupid
being
called
clever
What
is
the
quintessence
of
the
enterprise
culture
It
is
easy
or
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
conclusion
because
it
is
a
hard
job
to
change
people¡¯s
mindset
which
is
always
in
the
prejustice.So
at
first
we
must
scrutinize
the
origin
of
the
prejustice
why
are
so
many
people
always
just
negating
others
because
we
are
extremely
lack
of
communication
to
understand
with
each
other
lacking
of
wisdom
to
tell
the
right
and
the
wrong
lacking
of
the
wide
chest
to
tolerate
the
different
ideas
wnich
lead
to
misunderstand
among
people
and
to
form
the
impasse
to
flexibly
resolve
the
thorny
problem.There
are
some
words
similar
and
implicated
with
the
word
culture
in
dictionary
such
as
communication
concoct
cooperation
coordination
copartner
control¡±
