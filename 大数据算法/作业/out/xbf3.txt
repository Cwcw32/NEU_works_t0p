The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take
effect
on
Jan
1
2013
if
signed
by
the
president
into
law
Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov
told
local
media
Wednesday
that
Putin
would
consider
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
within
two
weeks
after
the
Federation
Council
approved
it
The
State
Duma
or

house
of
the
parliament
on
Friday
passed
the
bill
with
420
parliamentarians
voting
yes
seven
voting
against
and
one
abstaining
However
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
was
not
supported
by
all
the
Russians
On
Wednesday
the
Moscow
police
have
detained
four
people
near
the
Federation

building
who
were
protesting
against
the
bill
Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
in
November
1989
All

states
are
obliged
to
develop
and
undertake
all
actions
and
policies
in
the

of
the
best
interests
of

Many
provincial

have
created
detailed

to

With
these
measures
Party
authorities
are
attempting
to
get
closer
to
the

experts
said
We
have
seen
lots
of
fresh
working

from
the
newly

Party

such
as
fewer
cliches
at

no
traffic

during

Zhu

the
eight
measures
officials
should
reduce

Many
provincial-level

on

They

large
B2C
platforms
such
as
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
are
set
to
strengthen
their
lead
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
have
gradually
become
the
driving
force
of
the
nation's
e-commerce
industry
replacing
the
customer-to-customer
model
represented
by

an

International
Turnover
in
the
country's
B2C
e-commerce
sector
is
projected
to
reach
470
billion
yuan
in
2012
a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the
market
in
the
years
to
come
said
Chen
The
report
did
not
say
how
much
market
share
the
nation's
top
B2C
players
are
going
to
take
in
2013
In
November
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
accounted
for
more
than
70
percent
of
visits
to
Web
pages
in
the
B2C
sector
according
to
data
from
Huihui.cn
an
e-commerce
data
analysis
website
under

Top
brick-and-mortar

store
operators
such
as
Suning

Ltd
and
Gome
Electrical

also
joined
the

frenzy
said
the
report
Although
their
market
share
remains
small
compared
to
Tmall
and
Jingdong

the
traditional
retailers
online
operations
will
be
able
to
challenge
sector
leaders
in
the
long
run
it
said
In
addition
the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's
e-commerce
industry
is
set
to
decline
in
the
coming
years
partly
because
retailers
will
find
it
is
harder
to
attract
new
customers
Jingdong

pledged
to
explore
new
services
based
on
mobile
Internet
and
cloud
computing
technologies
in
a

to
attract
