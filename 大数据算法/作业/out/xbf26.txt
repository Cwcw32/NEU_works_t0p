and
teachers

so
in
the
two
years
younger
than
I
classmates
together
side
by
side
I
was
very
uncomfortable
psychological
also
feel
very
guilty
Only
this
guilt
and
inner
pain
no
one
can
imagine
Then
to
the
junior
high
school
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
neighborhood
folks
have
advised
me
not
to
read
so
I
went
to
town
to
work
I
seem
to
be
somewhat
unwilling
heart
did
not
listen
to
their
opinions
and
think
of
reading

reading
do
not
know
what
may
I
feel
lonely
stay
in
the
quiet
village
households
seem
dismal
alone
let
me
feel
very
afraid
so
I
read
no
matter
how
bad
but
also
to
the
nine
year
compulsory
education
school
But
I
think
the
day
time
is
long
etc

not

Sometimes
I'm
afraid
aunt
nagging
uncle's
house

not
dare
to
go

And
from
that
time
I
love
to
read
a
Book
habits
mother's
good
at
saying
you
read
a
book
are
admitted
to
a
university
so
you
really
go
to
read
a
book
you
don't
read
I
was
so
mom
a
nag
well
I
hate
to
take
all
of
the
book
to
burn
My
graduation
exam
is
over
a
long
time
I
didn't
know
how
to
grade
their
own
have
been
waiting
when
my
anxiety
to
fifth
days
at
the
same
time
the
junior
middle
school
admission
notice
to
can
not
write
performance
I
can
not
find
out
their
performance
is
bad
or
good
not
over
the
admission
notice
I
was
happy
but
when
the
notice
it
but
found
that
there
was
no
money
at
home
for
me
to
read
and
I
feel
it
This
day
Friday
daddy

out
as
I
gather
books

home
and
left
me
and
my
mother
two
Father
outside
money
very
hard
a
week
later
did
not
wait
for
the
dad
who
come
back
home
I
was
boring
occasionally
also
help
mother
do
some
housework
but
most
of
the
time
I
am
a
person
sits
on
the
bed
or
on
the
wheelchair
When
I
was
home
to
sit
to
uncle
home
to
flow
because
the
uncle's
path
is
the
only
way
which
must
be
passed
on
the
junior
high
school
so
when
the
school
in
the
school
I'll
be
watching
them
back
and
forth
it
seems
that
I'm
reading
way
does
not
give
up
Father
borrow
money
did
not
come
back
but
the
family
tattle
and
prate
much
rise
when
aunt
in
my
ears
ago
often
nag
daddy
thing
I
feel
creepy
why
is
it
so
Dad
why
Dad
You
come
back
You
come
back
quickly
I
prefer
not
to
read
will
not
let
you
be
such
grievances
such
insults
Dad
Dad
What
are
you
Why
are
they
so
say
you
I
have
been
to
have
been
waiting
for
his
return
Aunt
said
your
father
too
do
bad
name
that
he
do
it
really
lost
your
face
For
a
start
I
don't
know
what
happened
the
mood
is
very
heavy
asked
aunt
how
Is
there
anything
so
so
serious
Aunt
aggravated
by
an
angry
tone
said
your
father
outside
in
order
to
give
you
borrow
books
first
to
your
aunt's
house
he
said
the
home
to
buy
cattle
need
to
borrow
money
so
aunt
to
know
no
such
thing
so
don't
borrow
To
the
ancient
city
of
leaf
Tingjia
your
father's
friends
said
to
buy
chemical
fertilizer
to
borrow
a
little
money
Tingjia
leaves
no
he
will
go
to
your
grandma's
house
to
you
two
uncle's
house
to
borrow
your
dad
said
is
to
build
a
house
your
uncle
happened
to
encounter
village
grow
there
ask
he
once
topic
was
exposed
he
had
to
go
to
Ningbo
and
the
town
of
Evergreen
s
aunt
s
home
to
borrow
they
have
had
to
go
to
Shangjie
discussed
In
fact
I
was
really
want
to
ask
why
he
did
know
go
to
Ningbo
to
evergreen
all
be
crystal
clear
isn't
he
is
immortal
But
I
think
if
I
really
ask
those
words
do
not
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
again
I
heard
a
few
times
she
simply
said
you
don't
read
simply
go
out
work
I
thought
if
Dad
comes
back
I
can't
read
but
sometimes
I
am
unwilling
heart
no
matter
what
was
advised
in
the
school
I
had
a
few
lessons
can
comfort
my
soul
As
for
the
aunt's
words
I
don't
want
to
hear
but
also
do
not
want
to
use
it
The
school
school
for
several
days
Dad
Don't
see
at
that
time
I
was
a
little
worried
but
those
tattle
and
prate
is
not
stopped
but
also
the
diffusion
constant
at
While
I
thought
in
my
mind
my
father
come
back
and
side
wanted
dad
to
lend
money
to
come
back
I
can
take
a
good
read
I
do
not
want
to
give
up
all
of
a
sudden
but
to
no
avail
since
the
tattle
and
prate
my
heart
was
tortured
to
death
Mom
In
addition
to
complaining
that
father
outside
sometimes
also
want
to
talk
to
scold
me
maybe
she
more
recently
than
I
was
upset
so
she
wants
to
say
I
she
said
to
me
and
I
don't
chew
sound
One
day
I
went
to
his
aunt's
house
because
the
boring
to
my
aunt's
house
behind
the
bamboo
inside
to
digging
up
bamboo
shoots
when
I
really
dig
vigorously
suddenly
heard
the
mother's
cry
I
came
down
to
see
his
aunt
said
Daddy
things
let
s
lose
face
so
my
mother
sometimes
hard
to
explain
for
oneself
sometimes
feel
helpless
because
she
feels
she
jumped
into
the
the
Yellow
River
wash
not
clear
so
she
felt
wronged
cry
In
fact
say
mother
instigated
is
possible
the
key
is
my
own
request
forcing
the
father
in
the
back
of
the
eternal
infamy
to
say
in
the
final
analysis
is
my
fault
so
I
ought
to
I
heard
my
mother
weeping
I
also
feel
very
sad
This
a
few
days
later
mother's
mood
has
not
been
good
if
not
more
I
see
my
mother
like
this
is
very
worried
After
a
few
days
of
school
another
week
has
passed
I
also
miss
dad
Don't
know
Dad
outside
doing
may
be
I
worry
most
X
x
on
the
evening
the
sun
nearly
down
hill
Dad
came
back
I
go
first
call
dad
like
my
father
and
several
years
not
to
meet
such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
say
uncle
s
contribution
but
not
all
because
I
have
three
hundred
yuan
to
make
books
uncle
didn't
go
with
me
in
the
said
dad
before
he
has
not
called
me
to
junior
high
school
but
a
three
again
three
advised
me
to
give
up
reading
now
papa
got
money
made
a
part
of
my
books
I
read
to
say
to
their
credit
is
a
little
exaggerated
Father
left
home
also
no
rest
was
mother
shouted
did
mother's
grievance
venting
gas
while
the
father
was
annoyed
do
not
know
to
whom
to
tell
he
ll
go
Mother
said
you
come
The
money
for
you
to
cheat
here
Oh
So
good
people
like
you
fool
money
you
go
begging
Dad
shouted
who
said
that
To
who
said
that
You
give
me
a
call
My
accusers
Mother
said
without
confrontation
the
village
has
spread
to
open
You
to
the
village
to
make
inquiries
will
know
You're
so
listen
to
them
they
have
so
good
Dad
said
Mother
said
your
sister-in-law
also
said
do
not
believe
you
can
go
and
ask
him
do
their
own
things
to
know
Later
my
father
also
do
not
know
to
have
to
confront
this
thing
Buleerle
But
the
father
and
mother
are
very
long
time
had
not
spoken
always
keep
silence
state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
