meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
to
bakeries
We
are
keeping
the
price
of
bread
at
15
lira
about
21
U.S
cents
which
was
its
true
price
Abu
Adnan
said
adding
that
transgressors
would
be
punished
according
to
Shari¡®a
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
also
thus
far
avoided
indiscriminate
civilian
casualties
That¡¯s
not
to
say
that
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
have
fierce
critics
especially
within
rebel
circles
In
addition
to
its
civilian
detractors
many
more
secular-minded
fighters
are
wary
of
the
group¡¯s
social
conservatism
but
insist
that
its
brand
of
ultraconservative
Islam
will
not
find
a
home
in
any
post-Assad
Syria
These
fighters
often
say
that
they
will
deal
with
conservative
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
later
but
that
right
now
they
need
them
in
the
fight
against
Assad
Other
rebels
view
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
a
transient
jihadi
group
that
will
move
onto
foreign
fronts
like
Afghanistan
or
Gaza
after
the
fall
of
Assad
Abu
Adnan
smirked
when
asked
to
comment
about
such
sentiments
especially
by
fellow
Sunni
fighters
whom
he
dismissed
as
the
brainwashed
He
repeated
that
the
idea
that
we
are
a
global
organization
or
that
we
have
some
other
goal
elsewhere
after
the
fall
is
not
true
He
was
emphatic
We
are
Syrians
He
admitted
that
we
also
have
foreigners
who
came
from
other
countries
but
he
explained
that
is
because
the
wounds
in
the
Arab
lands
are
the
same
wound
and
the
oppression
is
the
same
oppression
A
minute
I
always
feel
so
long
Think
of
me
and
your
chance
Less
and
less
as
if
by
the
end
of
life
We
separate
with
each
other
The
world
of
two
people
each
other
again
A
minute
I'm
drunk
wine
a
few
times
The
evening
of
that
day
I'm
a
night
did
not
return
you
want
to
A
minute
Appear
in
front
of
you
you
want
me
to
repent
But
time
constraints
no
waiting
a
minute
Is
the
morning
you
find
I'm
a
night
that
night
Who
knows
in
the
noon
time
I
am
the
soft
bed
happy
to
sleep
But
you
have
to
use
a
minute
Wake
me
up
the
rumble
of
the
scolded
I
feel
very
feel
shy
When
I
want
to
take
a
minute
to
make
up
But
you
never
give
me
a
chance
And
you
say
we
are
the
best
choice
to
leave
I
used
a
few
years
time
Build
a
charming
scenery
wall
And
now
you
say
collapse
will
collapse
I'm
unwilling
heart
want
to
take
a
minute
To
redeem
my
fault
I
beg
you
said
to
me
Not
I
do
not
give
you
the
opportunity
But
given
the
opportunity
you
have
to
cherish
So
we
each
other
to
leave
for
good
That
night
the
minutes
But
it
doesn't
make
you
took
from
my
dreams
May
the
minute
for
you
Is
already
in
the
past
for
me
A
minute
is
an
indelible
scar
Forever
in
your
heart
the
brand
mark
The
nine
seven
half
of
the
year
I
graduated
from
the
primary
school
took
more
than
two
months
holiday
oneself
in
boring
boring
nothing
for
me
to
do
Probably
because
I
was
in
primary
school
has
over
two
times
the
level
or
that
I
was
in
the
primary
school
stage
without
ambition
my
result
difference
make
them
disappointed
disappointed
again
in
helpless
situation
teachers
do
not
stay
in
my
class
From
the
beginning
to
repeat
things
because
be
informed
parents
I
have
the
opinion
very
much
but
that
s
not
for
me
to
say
but
parents
and
teachers
say
so
in
the
two
years
younger
than
I
classmates
together
side
by
side
I
was
very
uncomfortable
psychological
also
feel
very
guilty
Only
this
guilt
and
inner
pain
no
one
can
imagine
Then
to
the
junior
high
school
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
neighborhood
folks
have
advised
me
not
to
read
so
I
went
to
town
to
work
I
seem
to
be
somewhat
unwilling
heart
did
not
listen
to
their
opinions
and
think
of
reading
mind
reading
do
not
know
what
may
I
feel
lonely
stay
in
the
quiet
village
households
seem
dismal
alone
let
me
feel
very
afraid
so
I
read
no
matter
how
bad
but
also
to
the
nine
year
compulsory
education
school
But
I
think
the
day
time
is
long
etc
several
day
has
not
yet
come
psychological
anxious
Sometimes
I'm
afraid
aunt
nagging
uncle's
house
did
not
dare
to
go
have
been
at

And
from
that
time
I
love
to
read
a
Book
habits
mother's
good
at
saying
you
read
a
book
are
admitted
to
a
university
so
you
really
go
to
read
a
book
you
don't
read
I
was
so
mom
a
nag
well
I
hate
to
take
all
of
the
book
to
burn
My
graduation
exam
is
over
a
long
time
I
didn't
know
how
to
grade
their

I
can
not
find
out
their

is
bad
or

the
admission
notice
I
was
happy
but
when
the
notice

found
that
there
was
no
