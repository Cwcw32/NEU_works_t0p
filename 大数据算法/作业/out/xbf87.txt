and
my

Sitting

Some

Thankfully
Have

Accompany

she
is
still
your
mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left
Thomas
Carlyle
lived
from
1795
until
1881
He
was
a
10000
wow
gold
Scot
essayist
and
historian
During
his
lifetime
he
became
one
of
the
world's
greatest
writers
But
he
was
a
human
and

On

Carlyle
married
his
secretary
Jane
Welsh
She
was
an
intelligent
attractive
and
somewhat
temperamental
daughter
of
a
well-to-do
doctor
They
had
their
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
but
still
loved
Bathroom
Vanities
each
other
dearly
After
their
marriage
Jane
continued
to
serve
as
his
secretary
But
after
several
years
of
marriage
Jane
became
ill
Being
Bathroom
Mirrors
a
hard
worker
Carlyle
became
so
absorbed
in
his
writings
that
he
let
Jane
continue
working
for
several
weeks
after
she
became
ill
She
had
cancer
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
slow
growing
kind
she
finally
became
confined
to
her
bed
Although
Carlyle
loved
her
Bathroom
Accessories
dearly
he
very
seldom
found
time
to
stay
with
her
long
He
was
busy
with
his
work
when
Jane
died
they
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
for
the
service
The
day
Glass
Basin
was
a
miserable
day
It
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
Following
the
funeral
Carlyle
went
back
to
his
home
He
was
taking
it
pretty
hard
He
went
up
the
stairs
to
Jane's
room
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
her
bed
He
sat
there
thinking
Shower
Enclosures
about
how
little
time
he
had
spent
with
her
and
wishing
so
much
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
differently
Noticing
her
diary
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
picked
it
up
and
began
to
steel
shelving
read
it
Suddenly
he
seemed
shocked
He
saw
it
There
on
one
page
she
had
written
Interior
Doors
a
single
line
Yesterday
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
and
it
was
like
heaven
I
love
him
so
Something
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
He
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
that
he
meant
so
much
to
her
He
thought
of
all
wow
gold
australia
the
times
he
had
gone
about
his
work
without
thinking
about
and
noticing
her
Then
Carlyle
turned
the
page
in
the
diary
There
he
noticed
she
racking
had
written
some
words
that
broke
his
heart
I
have
listened
all
day
to
hear
his
steps
in
the
hall
but
now
it
is
late
and
I
guess
he
won't
come
today
Carlyle
read
a
little
more
in
the
book
Then
he
threw
it
down
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Some
of
his
friends
found
him
at
the
grave
his
buy
wow
gold
australia
face
buried
in
the
mud
His
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
Tears
continued
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
He
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
If
I
had
only
known
if
I
had
only
known
But
it
was
too
late
for
Carlyle
She
was
dead
After
Jane's
death
Carlyle
made
world

warcraft
gold
for
sale
little
attempt
to
write
again
The
historians
say
he
lived
another
15
years
weary
bored
and
a
partial
recluse
I
share
the
