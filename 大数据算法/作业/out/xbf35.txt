Mandela
has
a

of

problems
dating
back
to
when
he
contracted

18
years
on

to

and
this
was

on

and
said
the

was
doing

Mandela
was
also
admitted
to
hospital
in
February
because
of
abdominal
pain
but
released
the
following
day
after
a
keyhole
examination
showed

of

since
then
in
another

in
Qunu
his
ancestral
village
in
the
impoverished

His
poor
health
has
prevented
him
from
making

A
religious
scholar
and
Shari¡®a
law
official
in
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
leadership
in
the
Aleppo
area
the
35-year-old
had
a
ready
answer
for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We
know
the
West
and
its
oppressive
ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N
Security
Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity

A
potential
recruit
must
undertake

religious-training
course

morals

15-to-20-day
military-training
program

That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
