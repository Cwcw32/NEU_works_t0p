can
put
his
things
he
returned
to
the
He
had
to
accept
to
let
them
D's
until
the
patrol
had
gone
he
said
how
can
you
not
carefully
let
the
guard
discovered
I
said
I
don't
know
How
do
I
know
the
night
police
so
fiercely
knew
that
I
wouldn't
back
out
D's
continued
next
to
a
sharp
point
don't
be
so
idiotic
Know
or
not
Said
oh
Know
Put
out
the
light
then
we
sleep
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
sleep
at
night
because
the
room
was
at
night
is
also
very
difficult
to
eliminate
unless
the
outside
temperature
drops
to
the
upper
20s
degrees
after
midnight
there
may
be
more
comfortable
Wake
up
the
first
thing
I
do
is
to
wash
brush
work
then
I
put
a
few
of
the
ash
bucket
and
a
large
shovels
and
in
D
s
back
leading
me
to
play
first
In
fact
I
don't
know
what
is
hard
what
is
helpless
life
I
have
not
try
at
home
parents
regard
me
as
a
saint
as
for
at
that
time
I
feel
so
blessed
and
now
I
can
only
obey
D's
leadership
as
his
apprentice
I
came
to
the
city
gates
then
turn
to
the
Old
Road
South
Gate
Street
South
Gate
Street
rely
on
the
Fuchun
River
and
that
a
large
river
it
is
the
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
we
stand
position
is
the
Fuchun
River
ferry
terminal
just
because
it
is
against
the
direction
of
the
city
to
the
South
so
it
means
draw
road
also
known
as
South
Gate
Street
near
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
I
came
here
did
not
look
at
the
moon
not
here
on
vacation
trip
or
something
I
was
just
a
young
worker
come
to
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
many-storied
buildings
work
most
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
river
I
and
it
are
not
fate
I
climbed
to
the
six
floor
of
this
building
opened
the
door
there
are
several
woodworking
early
start
working
here
their
decoration
process
of
half
I
come
here
only
a
toilet
and
a
wing
not
paved
tiles
This
is
D
s
and
I
started
to
do
it
My
first
day
at
work
is
to
carry
cement
bag
or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too
much
I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
is
D
s
wake
me
from
this
dream
urged
me
to
go
to
work
I
mistily
mistily
to
get
up
go
to
work
work
on
the
path
of
two
feet
in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a
little
be
petrified
like
How
can
I
not
to
mention
the
spirit
Seems
to
me
the
wholeEven
if
more
magnificent
rhetoric
Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk
the
voice
Beat
the
floor
Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me
babble
learn
language
I
learned
to
language
in
the
river
The
first
word-mom
How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only
for
repel
mosquitoes
Breeze
send
me
to
sleep
But
regardless
of
the
eyebrows
climb
sweat
poured
Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite
write
of
word
Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
and
vertical
dignified
and
imposing
You
said
that
a
man
have
to
like
it
Young
i
was
not
sensible
Occasionally
make
a
mistake
You
taught
me
the
force
of
justice
I
keep
in
mind
your
word
Dare
not
have
a
bit
slight
In
order
to
build
a
quiet
environment
for
my
studies
The
already
heavy
burden
of
the
family
You
take
on
all
the
housework
and
farm
work
Even
if
was
too
tired
to
take
a
breath
Also
won't
let
me
take
part
in
I
was
moved
to
nothing
to
say
In
my
memory
You've
never
luxury
one
coin
You
let
me
know
what
is
bitter
What
is
sweet
In
your
reference
I
have
learned
to
pinch
and
scrape
On
the

Several
times
i
want
to
surrender

of
incentive
of
look
in
the
eyes
You
earnestly
teaching
Let
me

Taken
the
pace
of
progress
Youth
at
a
loss
You
listen
to
me
dribs
and
drabs
And
give
me
all
of
the
analysis
and
directions
I
like
the
blind
man
to
regain
the
light
when
injustice
and
resentment
All
the
world
don't
understand
me
Only
you
know
me
In
you
here
I
got
the
light
when
faced
with
the
choices
I
hesitate
to
stray
around
You
give
me
advice¡¢contrast
But
you
won¡¯t
interfere
in
my
choice
Because

every
day
watching

posture
standing
on
the
roadside
inserted

see
countless
people
from
my
side
deadpan
passed
by
they
came
on
with
the
coffee
holding
a
drink
take
the
textbook
with
mobile
phone
They
be
in
a
hurry
to
depart
put
me
off
like
an
idle
about
Occasionally
someone
stopped

at
me
I
know

the
warmth
of
my
life

will
never
abandon

me
your

panic
Those
who
have
and
be
crazy
with
me
with
sadness
with
cycling
through
the
thin
youth
friend
I
think
we
all
remember
the
youth
is
how
we
face
cannot
erase
the
traces
