was
of
me
I
had
the
best
teacher
I
said
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
He
smiled
a
little
And
we
shook
hands
firmly
for
the
last
time
Several
days
later
at
about
4
A.M
my
mother
heard
Dad
shuffling
about
their
dark
room
I
have
some
things
I
have
to
do
he
said
He
paid
a
bundle
of
bills
He
composed
for
my
mother
a
long
list
of
legal
and
financial
what-to-do's
in
case
of
emergency
And
he
wrote
me
a
note
Then
he
walked
back
to
his
bed
and
laid
himself
down
He
went
to
sleep
naturally
And
he
did
not
wake
up
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial
Party
committees
have
created
detailed
policies
to
improve
their
working
style
as
required
by
the
country's
core
leadership
With
these
measures
Party
authorities
are
attempting
to
get
closer
to
the
public
experts
said
We
have
seen
lots
of
fresh
working
styles
from
the
newly
elected
Party
leaders
such
as
fewer
cliches
at
conferences
no
traffic
controls
during
inspection
tours
and
so
on
said
Zhu
Lijia
a
professor
of
public
administration
research
at
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Governance
But
Party
authorities
should
enhance
supervision
and
those
who
violate
regulations
should
be
punished
he
added
In
a
10-item
regulation

be
limited
to
less
than
45
minutes
in

According
to
the

the
eight
measures
officials
should
reduce
bureaucratic

Many
provincial-level
Party

and
main
Party
leaders
a
term
that
usually
refers
to
Party

there
should
be
less
than
five
municipal
officials
and
fewer
than
three
county
officials
the
Beijing
municipal
Party
committee
said
on
Dec
19
in
a
document
implementing
the
eight
measures
Beijing
municipal

should
eat

I

Michelle
Obama

said
their
grueling
campaign
schedules

them
two

And
the

continued
And
that¡¯s
my
honey
giving
me
a

We¡¯ve

MOSCOW
Dec
26
Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans
on
U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against
Russians
abroad
and
persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take
effect
on
Jan
1
2013
if
signed
by
the
president
into
law
Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov
told
local
media
Wednesday
that
Putin
would
consider
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
within
two
weeks
after
the
Federation
Council
approved
it
The
State
Duma
or
lower
house
of
the
parliament
on
Friday
passed
the
bill
with
420
parliamentarians
voting
yes
seven
voting
against
and
one
abstaining
However
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
was
not
supported
by
all
the
Russians
On
Wednesday
the
Moscow
police
have
detained
four
people
near
the
Federation
Council
building
who
were
protesting
against
the
bill
Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
in
November
1989
All
member
states
are
obliged
to
develop
and
undertake
all
actions
and
policies
in
the
light
of
the
best
interests
of
a
child
Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
Users
shall
be
responsible
for
reclaiming
the
same
area
and
quality
of
cultivated
land
they
use
for
construction
of
non-agricultural
projects
the
Land
Administration
Law
stipulates
Wang
Yunkun
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of
compensated
land
and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State
Council
or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens
or
hundreds
of
years
he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures
from
the
report
showed
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
