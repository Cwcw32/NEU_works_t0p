don't
read
simply
go
out
work
I
thought
if
Dad
comes
back
I
can't
read
but
sometimes
I
am
unwilling
heart
no
matter
what
was
advised
in
the
school
I
had
a
few
lessons
can
comfort
my
soul
As
for
the
aunt's
words
I
don't
want
to
hear
but
also
do
not
want
to
use
it
The
school
school
for
several
days
Dad
Don't
see
at
that
time
I
was
a
little
worried
but
those
tattle
and
prate
is
not
stopped
but
also
the
diffusion
constant
at
While
I
thought
in
my
mind
my
father
come
back
and
side
wanted
dad
to
lend
money
to
come
back
I
can
take
a
good
read
I
do
not
want
to
give
up
all
of
a
sudden
but
to
no
avail
since
the
tattle
and
prate
my
heart
was
tortured
to
death
Mom
In
addition
to
complaining
that
father
outside
sometimes
also
want
to
talk
to
scold
me
maybe
she
more
recently
than
I
was
upset
so
she
wants
to
say
I
she
said
to
me
and
I
don't
chew
sound
One
day
I
went
to
his
aunt's
house
because
the
boring
to
my
aunt's
house
behind
the
bamboo
inside
to
digging
up
bamboo
shoots
when
I
really
dig
vigorously
suddenly
heard
the
mother's
cry
I
came
down
to
see
his
aunt
said
Daddy
things
let
s
lose
face
so
my
mother
sometimes
hard
to
explain
for
oneself
sometimes
feel
helpless
because
she
feels
she
jumped
into
the
the
Yellow
River
wash
not
clear
so
she
felt
wronged
cry
In
fact
say
mother
instigated
is
possible
the
key
is
my
own
request
forcing
the
father
in
the
back
of
the
eternal
infamy
to
say
in
the
final
analysis
is
my
fault
so
I
ought
to
I
heard
my
mother
weeping
I
also
feel
very
sad
This
a
few
days
later
mother's
mood
has
not
been
good
if
not
more
I
see
my
mother
like
this
is
very
worried
After
a
few
days
of
school
another
week
has
passed
I
also
miss
dad
Don't
know
Dad
outside
doing
may
be
I
worry
most
X

on
the
evening
the
sun
nearly
down
hill
Dad
came
back
I
go
first
call
dad
like
my
father
and
several
years
not
to
meet
such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
say
uncle
s
contribution
but
not
all
because
I
have
three
hundred
yuan
to
make
books
uncle
didn't
go
with
me
in
the
said
dad
before
he
has
not
called
me
to
junior
high
school
but
a
three

advised
me
to
give
up

now
papa

a
part
of
my
books
I
read
to
say

their
credit
is
a
little
exaggerated
Father
left
home
also
no
rest
was
mother

mother's
grievance

while
the
father
was
annoyed

Dad

that
To

said
that
You

call
My
accusers
Mother
said
without
confrontation

You're

Mother
said
your
sister-in-law
also
said

not
believe
you
can
go
and
ask

their
own
things

Later
my

do
not

have
to
confront

thing

But
the
father
and
mother
are
very
long
time

not
spoken

keep
silence
state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
very
so
stay
at
home
for
too
long
you
feel
so
lonely
and
boring

also
I
have
no
job
but
feel
puzzled
think
it
over
and
over
again

no
friends
who
can
help
me

Although
the

look
forward
to

of
the

me
to
go
to
the
city
to
do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or
promises

at
that
time
I
have
been
in

is
the
question
of

be
well
orderly
and
you

and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother
and
friends
will
look
down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said
you

now
but
really
to
the
city
after
you
is
it
right
Our
words
as

inlet
and
an
outlet
to
forget
about
and
do
I
hope
you
not
if

wouldn't
want
to
control
you
The

I
in
the
night
imperceptibly
in
wheezing
to
sleep
Early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
I
also
in
outdoor
breathe
fresh
air
waiting
for

breakfast
eat
a
good
meal
with
my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also

Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or

it
D's

assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her

My
father
put
the
money
back

looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
