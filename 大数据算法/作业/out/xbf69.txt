researchers
estimated
on
Wednesday
They
added
that
large
B2C
platforms
such
as
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
are
set
to
strengthen
their
lead
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
have
gradually
become
the
driving
force
of
the
nation's
e-commerce
industry
replacing
the
customer-to-customer
model
represented
by
Taobao.com

an

Analysys
International
Turnover
in
the
country's
B2C
e-commerce
sector
is
projected
to
reach
470
billion
yuan
in
2012
a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the
market
in
the
years
to
come
said
Chen
The
report
did
not
say
how
much
market
share
the
nation's
top
B2C
players
are
going
to
take
in
2013
In
November
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
accounted
for
more
than
70
percent
of
visits
to
Web
pages
in
the
B2C
sector
according
to
data
from
Huihui.cn
an
e-commerce
data
analysis
website
under

Top
brick-and-mortar
chain
store
operators
such
as
Suning
Appliance
Co
Ltd
and
Gome
Electrical
Appliances
Holdings
Ltd
also
joined
the
e-commerce
frenzy
said
the
report
Although
their
market
share
remains
small
compared
to
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
the
traditional
retailers
online
operations
will
be
able
to
challenge
sector
leaders
in
the
long
run
it
said
In
addition
the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's
e-commerce
industry
is
set
to
decline
in
the
coming
years
partly
because
retailers
will
find
it
is
harder
to
attract
new
customers
Jingdong

pledged
to
explore
new
services
based
on
mobile
Internet

technologies
in

it

Mandela
has
a
history
of
lung
problems
dating
back
to
when
he
contracted
tuberculosis
while
in

spent
27
years
in
prison
including
18
years
on
the
windswept
Robben

off

The
former

was
admitted
to
a
Pretoria
hospital
on
December

and
this
was
his
longest
stay
in

since
he
was

Mandela
on
Christmas
Day
and
said
the
former
South
African
leader
was
doing
much
better
making
progress
and
in

Mandela
was
also
admitted
to
hospital
in
February
because
of
abdominal
pain
but
released
the
following
day
after
a
keyhole
examination
showed
there
was
nothing
seriously
wrong
with

has
spent
most
of
his
time
since
then
in
another
home
in
Qunu
his
ancestral
village
in
the
impoverished
Eastern
Cape
province
His
poor
health
has
prevented
him
from
making
any
public
appearances
in

past
two
years

he
has
continued
to

became

first
black
president
after
the
country's
first
all-race

from

used
his

to

A
religious
scholar
and
Shari¡®a
law
official
in
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
leadership
in
the
Aleppo
area
the
35-year-old
had
a
ready
answer
for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We
know
the
West
and
its
oppressive
ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N
Security
Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
