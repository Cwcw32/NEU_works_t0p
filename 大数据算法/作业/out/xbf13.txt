But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity
Smokers
need
not
apply
A
potential
recruit
must
undertake
a
10-day
religious-training
course
to
ascertain
his
understanding
of
religion
his
morals
his
reputation
A
15-to-20-day
military-training
program
follows
That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
the
vehicle
including
Abu
Adnan
who
silently
approached
the
car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not
introduce
himself
until
I
asked
who
he
was
later
We
drove
to
a
small
cold
concrete
room
with
a
tiny
window
that
barely
let
in
any
light
from
an
already
overcast
sky
We
sat
among
boxes
of
long-life
milk
and
bags
of
blankets
and
winter
clothes
waiting
to
be
distributed
Our
host
the
driver
tried
to
start
a
portable
gas
heater
but
there
was
no
gas
America
has
called
us
terrorists
because
it
says
that
some
of
our
tactics
bear
the
fingerprints
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de
guerre
of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
Israel
The
U.S
Treasury
Department
has
also
slapped
financial
sanctions
against
two
men
it
believes
are
senior
leaders
in
the
militia
group
Maysar
Ali
Musa
Abdallah
al-Juburi
and
Anas
Hasan
Khattab
Recent
media
reports
also
mention
one
Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
