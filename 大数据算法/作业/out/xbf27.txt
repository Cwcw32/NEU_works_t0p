Although
the

as
it
is
my
most
beautiful
dream
also
is
I
most
look
forward
to
come
to
one
of
the
city
but
because

because
I

next
day
morning
speeding
and
returned
to
his
hometown
urged
me
to
go
to
the
city
to
do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or
promises
probably
at
that
time
I
have
been
in

dream
of

there's
nothing
to
refuse

while

told
me
A
Cheng
You

to
the
city

must
listen
to
your
cousin's
arrangement
don't
go
out
on
a
night
out
that
will
make
your
brother
worry
will
let
us
worry
there
is
the
question
of
your
life
must
be
well
orderly
and
you
wear
and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother
and
friends
will
look
down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said
you
know
now
but
really
to
the
city
after
you
is
it
right
Our
words
as
unheeded
advice
that
an
inlet
and
an
outlet
to
forget
about
and
do
I
hope
you
not
if
you
so
dad
wouldn't
want
to
control
you
The
night
his
father
for
the
first
time
to
drink
is
also
the
first
time
that
I
drank
tincture
MOET
drunk
I
in
the
night
imperceptibly
in
wheezing
to
sleep
Early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
I
also
in
outdoor
breathe
fresh
air
waiting
for
mother
made
breakfast
eat
a
good
meal
with
my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also
can
Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or
accept
it
D's
said
rest
assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her
I
will
give
him
his
money
saved
in
the
home
My
father
put
the
money
back
pocket
looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
that
here
was
the
last
miss
that
my
heart
is
full
of
hope
full
of
ideals
is
my
nostalgia
reminds
me
of
the
beauty
of
my
hometown
As
tears
like
springs
that
my
surging
mood
as
in
heaven
so
here
swear
resolutely
obey
D's
command
I
went
to
Lake
source
direction
to
horse
sword
shift
car
went
straight
to
the
F
town
Go
forward
with
great
strength
and
vigour
to
the
F
city
F
City
we
in
the
long-distance
passenger
station
of
the
car
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
city
I
think
it's
great
it
is
because
I
first
saw
the
perfect
city
probably
for
the
city
people
the
city
is
not
big
because
there
are
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
such
as
Shanghai
Hangzhou
Nanjing
are
so
But
I
look
I
see
it
is
because
I
have
no
contact
with
the
city
and
the
first
contact
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
novelty
I
felt
that
here
is
my
dream
of
heaven
D
s
first
got
out
of
the
car
I
have
to
get
off
the
streets
together
with
him
I
don't
know
what
this
is
what
Lane
Road
always
feel
in
the
alley
as
in
gossip
so
I
feel
I
can't
touch
the
North
East
and
touched
the
East
has
touched
the
north
deeply
he
was
puzzled
When
I
came
to
a
river
river
sides
erected
a
high-rise
blocks
I
always
thought
that
this
is
the
Fuchun
River
I
really
think
you
saw
the
Fuchun
River
I
was
a
sigh
and
said
the
Fuchun
River
does
not
have
such
a
river
I
didn't
necessarily
it
big
D's
said
this
is
not
the
Fuchun
River
but
an
amaranth
Pujiang
I
said
oh
It
is
my
illusion
Words
I
am
his
behind
but
when
we
are
at
the
crossroads
in
the
middle
turn
right
this
is
a
long
hill
road
Liuzhou
Road
building
is
bristly
and
let
me
feel
the
perfect
city
economy
is
thriving
and
prosperous
each
poineering
hardships
may
make
it
difficult
to
imagine
as
I
came
to
a
world
came
to
a
childhood
paradise
I
see
a
paradise
of
dream
in
my
nose
to
dazzle
along
the
road
of
hill
of
dragon
of
the
past
it
is
a
city
surrounded
by
people
in
and
out
of
the
mall
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
in
the
commercial
city
upstairs
to
write
the
Fuchun
River
commercial
city
it
seems
like
I
know
this
is
F
the
city's
most
bustling
shopping
center
the
most
bustling
sidewalks
I
just
want
to
say
the
city
of
F
F
really
great
I
came
to
this
strange
city
I
really
feel
in
this
strange
city
I
can
absorb
your
sunny
temperament
to
be
a
city
that
the
giants
I
am
going
to
show
themselves
When
I
didn't
see
enough
outside
downtown
scene
I
was
D's
to
the
commercial
city
there
are
all
the
stalls
food
stands
above
the
green
vegetables
eggplant
garlic
onion
bean
curd
a
kind
sister
church
where
D's
stall
led
me
here
and
sister
chatted
a
while
when
the
elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
is
to
eat
lunch
saw
us
big
brother
put
down
his
chopsticks
call
us
to
sit
down
then
O
O
said
A
Cheng
Your
dinner
have
you
had
dinner
yet
I
haven't
answered
D's
for
I
said
we
have
no
Big
brother
says
here
to
eat
not
home
to
burn
She
also
said
yes
Or
here
to
eat
even
home
to
burn
much
trouble
D's
said
not
so
polite
home
to
burn
it
it
didn't
take
long
very
fast
He
made
the
remarks
at
the
same
time
I
still
look
around
because
I
see
here
is
such
a
big
stall
is
also
the
first
time
saw
so
many
dishes
people
buy
vegetable
stall
So
my
curiosity
in
here
is
not
fun
When
I
put
the
spirit
are
concentrated
in
the
food
stalls
of
things
he
finished
on
the
go
I'm
still
hazy
a
bit
at
a
loss
situation
he
said
to
me
A
Cheng
we
go
I
didn't
hear
there
is
one
point
be
absent-minded
look
he
coaxed
out
of
said
hello
What's
on
your
mind
Told
you
so
loudly
did
not
hear
Go
I
said
oh
Elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
to
pick
some
fresh
vegetables
let
you
bring
us
back
to
cook
he
and
I
left
sister
they
couple
booth
then
to
another
butcher
shop
stall
bought
several
kilograms
of
meat
left
the
commercial
city
and
imperceptibly
and
through
a
Malaysian
Road
came
to
a
named
Zhou
Jianong
lane
across
the
alley
alley
went
to
D's
house
D's
house
is
an
underground
garage
inside
a
very
the
smell
is
also
important
I
very
want
to
move
out
but
I
will
not
economic
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
environment
here
it
is
the
parents
of
thousand
exhort
enjoin
let
I
firmly
remember
them
you
want
me
to
listen
to
D's
so
I
had
to
reluctantly
stay
When
I
walked
inside
the
heat
from
the
outside
directly
to
heaven
so
I
really
feel
it's
hard
I
am
afraid
went
into
the
furnace
of
the
house
let
me
really
angry
be
ashamed
of
dying
When
I
was
in
the
hot
sun
dried
by
the
sun
at
the
same
time
