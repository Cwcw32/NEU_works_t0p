to
more
polluted
the
hearts
of
many
people
have
been
changed
by
desire
for
money
to
be
vicious
my
god
has
given
me
the
enlight
that
if
you
can
comprehend
the
love
the
truth
you
can
have
sheft
below
the
sunshine
which
would
fill
you
and
warm
you
so
it
is
my
fortunation
I
can
get
the
hints
from
god
giving
me
the
truth
which
fattened
my
twisted
raods
in
the
mist
and
I
can
smile
happily
and
never
be
frustrated
again
Even
if
I
explain
the
understanding
of
love
and
truth
again
and
again
lots
of
people
still
had
lof
of
question
on
my
comprehension
about
the
thoughts
as
same
as
my
past.in
my
past
I
was
puzzled
intensifiedly
on
some
meaningful
words.some
people
said
to
me
the
words
wisdom
but
it
is
like
a
fool
who
can
not
distinguish
what
is
right
or
wrong
I
am
delayed
to
understand
the
truth
which
stumbled
my
existence
and
made
me
fall
to
hell.but
the
darkness
is
not
always
having
no
light
maybe
my
god
has
pity
on
me
one
day
I
found
thoughts
can
change
my
action
my
attitude
to
the
life
I
confronted
that
is
in
the
embarrassed
condition.after
I
have
been
changed
to
the
peace
life
by
the
fresh
way
of
thinking
I
can
in
confidence
make
a
conclusion
that
please
believing
in
the
god¡¯s
soul
that
tell
you
what
is
yours
what
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
this
world
worthy
pusuring
you
should
love
should
dent
the
suffering
you
have
got
and
smiling
in
the
darkness
stubborn
and
everyone
would
follow
the
regulations
rooted
in
your
heart
thinking
of
the
company
as
your
own
our
enterprise
would
be
promising.The
safety
and
service
is
the
crux
to
our
enterprise
we
must
strengthen
our
consciousness
to
keep
them
in
our
mind
and
do
our
best
to
support
it
VIRTUE
is
like
a
rich
stone
best
plain
set
and
surely
virtue
is
best
in
a
body
that
is
comely
though
not
of
delicate
features
and
that
hath
rather
dignity
of
presence
than
beauty
of
aspect
Neither
is
it
almost
seen
that
very
beautiful
persons
are
otherwise
of
great
virtue
as
if
nature
were
rather
busy
not
to
err
than
in
labor
to
produce
excellency
And
therefore
they
prove
accomplished
but
not
of
great
spirit
and
study
rather
behavior
than
virtue
But
this
holds
not
always
for
Augustus
Caesar
Titus
Vespasianus
Philip
le
Belle
of
France
Edward
the
Fourth
of
England
Alcibiades
of
Athens
Ismael
the
Sophy
of
Persia
were
all
high
and
great
spirits
and
yet
the
most
beautiful
men
of
their
times
In
beauty
that
of
favor
is
more
than
that
of
color
and
that
of
decent
and
gracious
motion
more
than
that
of
favor
That
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
cannot
express
no
nor
the
first
sight
of
the
life
There
is
no
excellent
beauty
that
hath
not
some
strangeness
in
the
proportion
A
man
cannot
tell
whether
Apelles
or
Albert
Durer
were
the
more
trifler
whereof
the
one
would
make
a
personage
by
geometrical
proportions
the
other
by
taking
the
best
parts
out
of
divers
faces
to
make
one
excellent
Such
personages
I
think
would
please
nobody
but
the
painter
that
made
them
Not
but
I
think
a
painter
may
make
a
better
face
than
ever
was
but
he
must
do
it
by
a
kind
of
felicity
as
a
musician
that
maketh
an
excellent
air
in
music
and
not
by
rule
A
man
shall
see
faces
that
if
you
examine
them
part
by
part
you
shall
find
never
a
good
and
yet
altogether
do
well
If
it
be
true
that
the
principal
part
of
beauty
is
in
decent
motion
certainly
it
is
no
marvel
though
persons
in
years
seem
many
times
more
amiable
pulchrorum
autumnus
pulcher
for
no
youth
can
be
comely
but
by
pardon
and
considering
the
youth
as
to
make
up
the
comeliness
Beauty
is
as
summer
fruits
which
are
easy
to
corrupt
and
cannot
last
and
for
the
most
part
it
makes
a
dissolute
youth
and
an
age
a
little
out
of
countenance
but
yet
certainly
again
if
it
light
well
it
maketh
virtue
shine
and
vices
blush
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
It
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
first
memory
I
have
of
him

anything
