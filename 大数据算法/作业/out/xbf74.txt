This
is
D
s
and
I
started
to
do
it
My
first
day
at
work
is
to
carry
cement
bag
or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too
much
I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
is
D
s
wake
me
from
this
dream
urged
me
to
go
to
work
I
mistily
mistily
to
get
up
go
to
work
work
on
the
path
of
two
feet
in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a
little
be
petrified
like
How
can
I
not
to
mention
the
spirit
Seems
to
me
the
wholeEven
if
more
magnificent
rhetoric
Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk
the
voice
Beat
the
floor
Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me
babble
learn
language
I
learned
to
language
in
the
river
The
first
word-mom
How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only
for
repel
mosquitoes
Breeze
send
me
to
sleep
But
regardless
of
the
eyebrows
climb
sweat
poured
Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite
write
of
word
Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
and
vertical
dignified
and
imposing
You
said
that
a
man
have
to
like
it
Young
i
was
not
sensible
Occasionally
make
a
mistake
You
taught
me
the
force
of
justice
I
keep
in
mind
your
word
Dare
not
have
a
bit
slight
In
order
to
build
a
quiet
environment
for
my
studies
The
already
heavy
burden
of
the
family
You
take
on
all
the
housework
and
farm
work
Even
if
was
too
tired
to
take
a
breath
Also
won't
let
me
take
part
in
I
was
moved
to
nothing
to
say
In
my
memory
You've
never
luxury
one
coin
You
let
me
know
what
is
bitter
What
is
sweet
In
your
reference
I
have
learned
to
pinch
and
scrape
On
the
way

Several
times
i
want
to
surrender
You
full
of
incentive
of
look
in
the
eyes
You
earnestly
teaching
Let
me
confidence
Taken
the
pace
of
progress
Youth
at
a
loss
You
listen
to
me
dribs
and
drabs
And
give
me
all
of
the
analysis
and
directions
I
like
the
blind
man
to
regain
the
light
when
injustice
and
resentment
All
the
world
don't
understand
me
Only
you
know
me
In
you
here
I
got
the
light
when
faced
with
the
choices
I
hesitate
to
stray
around
You
give
me
advice¡¢contrast
But
you
won¡¯t
interfere
in
my
choice
Because

season
Once
again
cry
out
Mom
I
love
you
Wish
you
have
a
good
health
And
happy
every
dayHas
been
that
a
man
hiding
in
the
side
to
steal
cry
age
has
been
the
world
runs
age
has
not
remember
from
when
to
begin
planning
for
the
future
imagine
the
life
don't
remember
from
what
time
to
worry
more
and
more
I
started
back
to
have
a
look
their
growth
path
one
every
day
watching
I
alone
posture
standing
on
the
roadside
inserted
his
hands
in
pants
I
see
countless
people
from
my
side
deadpan
passed
by
they
came
on
with
the
coffee
holding
a
drink
take
the
textbook
with
mobile
phone
They
be
in
a
hurry
to
depart
put
me
off
like
an
idle
about
Occasionally
someone
stopped
smiled
at
me
I
know
these
people
stay
down
is
the
warmth
of
my
life
they
will
never
abandon
I
care
be
the
source
of
my
life
Guo
Jingming
said
my
friends
are
my
courage
to
live
and
they
give
me
your
ability
let
me
face
this
world
no
longer
panic
Those
who
have
and
be
crazy
with
me
with
sadness
with
cycling
through
the
thin
youth
friend
I
think
we
all
remember
the
youth
is
how
we
face
cannot
erase
the
traces
Xiao
chen
went
to
Hainan
in
a
dessert
shop
as
dessert
Whenever
we
have
a
vacation
will
be
received
her
phone
call
she
received
the
text
message
she
always
likes
to
write
very
long
As
it
was
she
knew
I
was
a
very
insecure
afraid
to
lose
even
if
there
is
no
important
will
also
write
a
long
message
let
me
know
her
by
my
side
never
leave
Chen
is
a
very
clever
girl
but
in
the
study
does
not
enlighten
after
each
test
there
will
always
be
that
her
poor
grades
in
my
front
side
into
my
mouth
ice
cream
a
begged
me
to
help
her
with
We
have
been
together
for
9
years
so
only
a
piece
of
memory
I
always
thought
she
was
a
bright
child
happy
and
simple
life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
