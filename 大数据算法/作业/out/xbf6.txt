The
report
was
delivered
by
an
inspection
group
sent
by
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
earlier
this
year
to
survey
the
enforcement
of
the
country's
Agriculture

China

and

large-scale
agricultural
operations
in
diverse
formIt
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial

MOSCOW
Dec
26
Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans
on
U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against
Russians
abroad
and
persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take
effect
on
Jan
1
2013
if
signed
by
the
president
into
law
Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov
told
local
media
Wednesday
that
Putin
would
consider
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
within
two
weeks
after
the
Federation
Council
approved
it
The
State
Duma
or
lower
house
of
the
parliament
on
Friday
passed
the
bill
with
420
parliamentarians
voting
yes
seven
voting
against
and
one
abstaining
However
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
was
not
supported
by
all
the
Russians
On
Wednesday
the
Moscow
police
have
detained
four
people
near
the
Federation
Council
building
who
were
protesting
against
the
bill
Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
