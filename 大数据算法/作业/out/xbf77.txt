giving
us
some
metaphor
or
euphemism
that
enterprise
culture
must
depend
on
the
communication
cooperation
must
control
the
ridiculous
behavior
of
some
officials
must
concoct
the
atmosphere
from
stiff
suffocated
environment
to
the
active
creative
philosophical
philanthropic
state
of
mindset
of
everyone.But
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
behavior
spontaneously
follow
the
bright
side
of
human
being
just
because
of
the
fragile
and
selfish
nature
of
people
with
some
ignorant
knowledge
about
themselves
so
using
the
regulations
to
control
the
devil
in
their
mindset
and
encouraging
the
bold
attitude
to
resolve
the
present
and
history
problem
is
the
essential
way
of
making
the
enterprise
culture
alive
and
giving
the
light
to
the
employee
We
must
change
the
thoughts
that
we
are
isolated
by
others
we
are
just
living
for
ourself
we
are
just
focusing
on
our
private
cases
to
the
thoughts
that
if
we
can
help
each
other
if
we
believe
in
the
philosophy
of
strengthenning
the
consciousness
of
doing
the
job
positively
and
wisely
getting
good
return
we
can
achieve
the
goal
of
making
our
company
profitful
and
competitive
even
making
our
life
happy
Why
are
the
employee
always
having
no
enthusiasm
and
lacking
of
a
little
responsibility
in
their
job?why
are
there
lots
of
complaint
in
our
company?why
are
the
talented
people
resigning
quickly
from
our
company?Yes
the
salary
is
the
key
and
having
no
feeling
in
cooperation
unity
belonging
and
having
not
the
promising
future
are
the
fundamental
reasons
which
steamrollerred
the
spirit
to
be
loyal
to
company
so
putting
the
importance
of
employee
in
priority
is
the
way
of
having
the
high
competition
in
this
globallized
world
A
healthy
company
is
the
one
that
urgently
need
the
creative
advices
from
employee
in
stead
of
closing
their
eyes
filling
in
their
ears
in
front
of
the
employee
who
may
have
some
profound
and
pragmatic
ideas
which
maybe
benifit
to
the
operation
of
our
company.But
how
to
distinguish
the
good
ideas
or
the
wrong
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
leaders
who
must
look
through
everything
including
themselves
and
others
adding
that
they
must
comprehend
the
logic
of
mindset
and
behavior
of
themself
To
be
leaders
the
open
attitude
is
the
good
way
to
rationalize
the
management
adopting
the
positive
way
to
eliminate
the
flaws
in
the
structure
and
to
attain
the
goal
with
attacking
the
black
hands¡±
instead
of
always
being
in
defensive
measure
of
healing
the
fissure
in
management
that
is
deficient
in
courage
and
wisdom.It
is
also
one
part
of
the
enterprise
culture.Frankly
saying
having
good
return
to
our
company
is
dominated
by
the
fate
by
the
hearts
of
all
employee
by
the
regulations
by
the
rational
philosophy
by
the
authentic
wisdom
Service
is
the
culture
it
sounds
like
simple
but
complicated
and
profound
if
you
want
to
make
it
better
and
better
How
to
do
service
is
the
important
culture
of
enterprise
which
could
attract
many
people
to
take
our
flights
again
and
again.We
can
ask
a
simple
question
that
if
you
look
up
to
see
the
twinkled
stars
in
night
what
make
you
comfortable?The
answer
is
easy
the
bright
the
color
make
you
feel
comfortable
which
can
make
us
have
some
comprehension
that
if
you
make
people¡¯s
body
such
as
eye
ear
limbs
nose
heart
feel
nice
your
service
is
the
nice
service
if
you
make
the
customers
angry
you
failed
in
doing
service.So
you
must
think
over
how
to
make
the
customers
feel
better
is
the
best
way
to
learn
how
to
give
service
to
these
arrogant
and
hypercritical
customers
Above
all
We
can
understand
that
if
you
have
regulations
in
your
mindset
which
sometimes
is
selfish
and
Out
of
my
window
the
darkness
gave
me
a
signal:if
you
are
habitted
in
the
darkness
of
heart
you
would
be
dissappionted
for
ever.sometimes
I
want
to
find
the
way
of
making
me
in
the
positive
attitude
to
the
life
but
always
are
beated
by
my
experiences
which
cutted
off
the
robe
attached
to
the
sunshine.but
the
frustrated
happenning
is
not
the
domination
which
converts
my
good
intention
to
the
devil
the
domination
is
my
thoughts
which
are
sometimes
not
superficial
but
profound
gives
me
the
light
and
warm
to
live
simply
and
happily
What
kind
of
thoughts
would
release
my
pressure
and
gives
me
the
ability
to
survive
in
the
chilly
and
choppy
reality
which
would
distort
the
heart
fragile
to
the
fragmentary
condition
or
make
the
heart
wisom
strong
get
the
meaning
of
life
which
would
push
me
to
the
heaven
with
lots
of
beauty
and
full
I
would
say
that
my
thoughts
is
related
to
the
thoughts
themselves
if
you
can
change
the
thoughts
quickly
and
correctedly
you
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
pusure
the
objects
you
want;if
you
are
stubborn
enough
you
would
be
easily
defeated
by
the
fate
which
urgently
need
the
wisdom
light
to
cover
the
black
in
the
mindset
full
of
good
and
evil
When
I
was
a
child
I
do
not
know
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
and
have
no
faith
which
would
comfort
my
soul
to
give
me
a
light
would
direct
my
road
to
the
tranquillized
home
My
pressure
is
from
my
family
where
my
father
is
not
a
reasonable
person
and
had
no
ideas
on
how
to
cultivate
my
individual
personality
and
my
character
so
in
the
long
time
I
felt
the
life
of
mine
is
in
hell
even
if
I
have
food
to
eat
have
cloth
to
wear
but
my
heart
was
in
deep
frustration
and
had
much
hatre
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
shaping
my
thoughts
that
the
life
had
not
power
to
lift
me
from
the
miserable
conditions.after
long
long
time
the
climate
has
been
changed
to
more
warm
the
rivers
have
been
changed
to
more
polluted
the
hearts
of
many
people
have
been
changed
by
desire
for
money
to
be
vicious
my
god
has
given
me
the
enlight
that
if
you
can
comprehend
the
love
the
truth
you
can
have
sheft
below
the
sunshine
which
would
fill
you
and
warm
you
so
it
is
my
fortunation
I
can
get
the
hints
from
god
giving
me
the
truth
which
fattened
my
twisted
raods
in
the
mist
and
I
can
smile
happily
and
never
be
frustrated
again
Even
if
I
explain
the
understanding
of
love
and
truth
again
and
again
lots
of
people
still
had
lof
of
question
on
my
comprehension
about
the
thoughts
as
same
as
my
past.in
my
past
I
was
puzzled
intensifiedly
on
some
meaningful
words.some
people
said
to
me
the
words
wisdom
but
it
is
like
a
fool
who
can
not
distinguish
what
is
right
or
wrong
I
am
delayed
to
understand
the
truth
which
stumbled
my
existence
and
made
me
fall
to
hell.but
the
darkness
is
not
always
having
no
light
maybe
my
god
has
pity
on
me
one
day
I
found
thoughts
can
change
my
action
my
attitude
to
the
life
I
confronted
that
is
in
the
embarrassed
condition.after
I
have
been
changed
to
the
peace
life
by
the
fresh
way
of
thinking
I
can
in
confidence
make
a
conclusion
that
please
believing
in
the
god¡¯s
soul
that
tell
you
what
is
yours
what
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
this
world
worthy
pusuring
you
should
love
should
dent
the
suffering
you
have
got
and
smiling
in
the
darkness
stubborn
and
everyone
would
follow
the
regulations
rooted
in
your
heart
thinking
of
the
company
as
your
own
our
enterprise
would
be
promising.The
safety
and
service
is
the
crux
to
our
enterprise
we
must
strengthen
our
consciousness
to
keep
them
in
our
mind
and
do
our
best
to
support
it
VIRTUE
is
like
a
rich
stone
best
plain
set
and
surely
virtue
is
best
in
a
body
that
is
comely
though
not
of
delicate
features
and
that
hath
rather
dignity
of
presence
than
beauty
of
aspect
Neither
is
it
almost
seen
that
very
beautiful
persons
are
otherwise
of
great
virtue
as
if
nature
were
rather
busy
not
to
err
than
in
labor
to
produce
excellency
And
therefore
they
prove
accomplished
but
not
of
great
spirit
and
study
rather
behavior
than
virtue
But
this
holds
not
always
for
Augustus
Caesar
Titus
Vespasianus
Philip
le
Belle
of
France
Edward
the
Fourth
of
England
Alcibiades
of
Athens
Ismael
the
Sophy
of
Persia
were
all
high
and
great
spirits
and
yet
the
most
beautiful
men
of
their
times
In
beauty
that
of
favor
is
more
than
that
of
color
and
that
of
decent
and
gracious
motion
more
than
that
of
favor
That
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
cannot
express
no
nor
the
first
sight
of
the
life
There
is
no
excellent
beauty
that
hath
not
some
strangeness
in
the
proportion
A
man
cannot
tell
whether
Apelles
or
Albert
Durer
were
the
more
trifler
whereof
the
one
would
make
a
personage
by
geometrical
proportions
the
other
by
taking
the
best
parts
out
of
divers
faces
to
make
one
excellent
Such
personages
I
think
would
please
nobody
but
the
painter
that
made
them
Not
but
I
think
a
painter
may
make
a
better
face
than
ever
was
but
he
must
do
it
by
a
kind
of
felicity
as
a
musician
that
maketh
an
excellent
air
in
music
and
not
by
rule
A
man
shall
see
faces
that
if
you
examine
them
part
by
part
you
shall
find
never
a
good
and
yet
altogether
do
well
If
it
be
true
that
the
principal
part
of
