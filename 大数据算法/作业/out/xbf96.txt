paradise
I
see
a
paradise
of
dream
in
my
nose
to
dazzle
along
the
road
of
hill
of
dragon
of
the
past
it
is
a
city
surrounded
by
people
in
and
out
of
the
mall
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
in
the
commercial
city
upstairs
to
write
the
Fuchun
River
commercial
city
it
seems
like
I
know
this
is
F
the
city's
most
bustling
shopping
center
the
most
bustling
sidewalks
I
just
want
to
say
the
city
of
F
F
really
great
I
came
to
this
strange
city
I
really
feel
in
this
strange
city
I
can
absorb
your
sunny
temperament
to
be
a
city
that
the
giants
I
am
going
to
show
themselves
When
I
didn't
see
enough
outside
downtown
scene
I
was
D's
to
the
commercial
city
there
are
all
the
stalls
food
stands
above
the
green
vegetables
eggplant
garlic
onion
bean
curd
a
kind
sister
church
where
D's
stall
led
me
here
and
sister
chatted
a
while
when
the
elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
is
to
eat
lunch
saw
us
big
brother
put
down
his
chopsticks
call
us
to
sit
down
then
O
O
said
A
Cheng
Your
dinner
have
you
had
dinner
yet
I
haven't
answered
D's
for
I
said
we
have
no
Big
brother
says
here
to
eat
not
home
to
burn
She
also
said
yes
Or
here
to
eat
even
home
to
burn
much
trouble
D's
said
not
so
polite
home
to
burn
it
it
didn't
take
long
very
fast
He
made
the
remarks
at
the
same
time
I
still
look
around
because
I
see
here
is
such
a
big
stall
is
also
the
first
time
saw
so
many
dishes
people
buy
vegetable
stall
So
my
curiosity
in
here
is
not
fun
When
I
put
the
spirit
are
concentrated
in
the
food
stalls
of
things
he
finished
on
the
go
I'm
still
hazy
a
bit
at
a
loss
situation
he
said
to
me
A
Cheng
we
go
I
didn't
hear
there
is
one
point
be
absent-minded
look
he
coaxed
out
of
said
hello
What's
on
your
mind
Told
you
so
loudly
did
not
hear
Go
I
said
oh
Elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
to
pick
some
fresh
vegetables
let
you
bring
us
back
to
cook
he
and
I
left
sister
they
couple
booth
then
to
another
butcher
shop
stall
bought
several
kilograms
of
meat
left
the
commercial
city
and
imperceptibly
and
through
a
Malaysian
Road
came
to
a
named
Zhou
Jianong
lane
across
the
alley
alley
went
to
D's
house
D's
house
is
an
underground
garage
inside
a
very
the
smell
is
also
important
I
very
want
to
move
out
but
I
will
not
economic
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
environment
here
it
is
the
parents
of
thousand
exhort
enjoin
let
I
firmly
remember
them
you
want
me
to
listen
to
D's
so
I
had
to
reluctantly
stay
When
I
walked
inside
the
heat
from
the
outside
directly
to
heaven
so
I
really
feel
it's
hard
I
am
afraid
went
into
the
furnace
of
the
house
let
me
really
angry
be
ashamed
of
dying
When
I
was
in
the
hot
sun
dried
by
the
sun
at
the
same
time
D's
said
why
don't
you
come
in
Quickly
Wash
dishes
I
went
to
go
say
to
him
it
is
too
hot
I
have
a
bit
of
a
bear
D's
continued
hot
A
fan
Do
not
be
afraid
of
heat
a
long
time
to
get
over
I
come
too
but
we
insist
on
the
stand
A
man
should
be
afraid
of
tired
we
are
so
out
of
practice
I
said
oh
Came
to
give
him
food
finished
lunch
he's
out
let
me
have
a
rest
at
home
for
a
day
starting
tomorrow
I
promised
D's
a
boring
also
have
a
look
at
the
room
television
occasionally
to
bring
home
the
story
books
doubled
the
old
warm
up
in
primary
and
secondary
schools
the
residual
reading
difficulty
One
day
in
the
imperceptibly
in
the
past
soon
arrived
at
dusk
D's
also
returned
to
cook
I
don't
know
how
to
cook
so
there
are
a
lot
of
housework
is
D's
one
person
to
complete
I
can
only
one
wash
dishes
clean
the
room
health
or
what
other
are
not
good
At
night
after
dinner
D's
and
I
had
to
watch
TV
in
bed
TV
also
is
no
good
program
I
watched
a
imperceptibly
fell
asleep
Suddenly
I
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
I
will
readily
but
here
I
can
not
find
the
toilet
was
anxious
to
panic
I
find
that
I
finally
find
convenient
corner
when
I
finished
returned
was
a
patrol
car
through
here
I
was
found
by
police
as
a
thief
was
caught
The
car
out
of
the
two
patrol
to
check
my
ID
card
I
came
to
the
interior
from
my
bag
show
identity
cards
to
give
them
they
took
out
the
register
put
my
name
and
identity
card
number
is
recorded
in
it
and
again
and
again
I
ask
my
family
and
address
then
they
contact
D
s
asked
his
identity
asked
his
work
address
information
is
very
detailed
and
they
have
put
D
s
identity
as
a
pledge
export
to
a
television
set
let
him
leave
the
TV
invoice
and
specifications
to
verify
can
put
his
things
he
returned
to
the
He
had
to
accept
to
let
them
D's
until
the
patrol
had
gone
he
said
how
can
you
not
carefully
let
the
guard
discovered
I
said
I
don't
know
How
do
I
know
the
night
police
so
fiercely
knew
that
I
wouldn't
back
out
D's
continued
next
to
a
sharp
point
don't
be
so
idiotic
Know
or
not
Said
oh
Know
Put
out
the
light
then
we
sleep
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
sleep
at
night
because
the
room
was
at
night
is
also
very
difficult
to
eliminate
unless
the
outside
temperature
drops
to
the
upper
20s
degrees
after
midnight
there
may
be
more
comfortable
Wake
up
the
first
thing
I
do
is
to
wash
brush
work
then
I
put
a
few
of
the
ash
bucket
and
a
large
shovels
and
in
D
s
back
leading
me
to
play
first
In
fact
I
don't
know
what
is
hard
what
is
helpless
life
I
have
not
try
at
home
parents
regard
me
as
a
saint
as
for
at
that
time
I
feel
so
blessed
and
now
I
can
only
obey
D's
leadership
as
his
apprentice
I
came
to
the
city
gates
then
turn
to
the
Old
Road
South
Gate
Street
South
Gate
Street
rely
on
the
Fuchun
River
and
that
a
large
river
it
is
the
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
we
stand
position
is
the
Fuchun
River
ferry
terminal
just
because
it
is
against
the
direction
of
the
city
to
the
South
so
it
means
draw
road
also
known
as
South
Gate
Street
near
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
I
came
here
did
not
look
at
the
moon
not
here
on
vacation
trip
or
something
I
was
just
a
young
worker
come
to
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
many-storied
buildings
work
most
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
river
I
and
it
are
not
fate
I
climbed
to
the
six
floor
of
this
building
opened
the
door
there
are
several
woodworking
early
start
working
here
their
decoration
process
of
half
I
come
here
only
a
toilet
and
a
wing
not
paved
tiles
This
is
D
s
and
I
started
to
do
it
My
first
day
at
work
is
to
carry
cement
bag
or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too
much
I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
is
D
s
wake
me
from
this
dream
urged
me
to
go
to
work
I
mistily
mistily
to
get
up
go
to
work
work
on
the
path
of
two
feet
in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a
little
be
petrified
like
How
can
I
not
to
mention
the
spirit
Seems
to
me
the
wholeEven
if
more
magnificent
rhetoric
Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk
the
voice
Beat
the
floor
Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me
babble
learn
language
I
learned
to
language
in
the
river
The
first
word-mom
How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only
for
repel
mosquitoes
Breeze
send
me
to
sleep
But
regardless
of
the
eyebrows
climb
sweat
poured
Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite
write
of
word
Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
