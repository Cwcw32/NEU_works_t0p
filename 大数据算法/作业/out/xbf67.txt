his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
again
until
it
was
firm
enough
As
time
passed
there
were
other
rules
to
learn
Always
do
your
best.""Do
it
now.""Never
lie
And
most
importantly
"You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
By
my
teens
he
wasn't
telling
me
what
to
do
anymore
which
was
scary
and
heady
at
the
same
time
He
provided
perspective
not
telling
me
what
was
around
the
great
corner
of
life
but
letting
me
know
there
was
a
lot
more
than
just
today
and
the
next
which
I
hadn't
thought
of
One
day
I
realize
now
there
was
a
change
I
wasn't
trying
to
please
him
so
much
as
I
was
trying
to
impress
him
I
never
asked
him
to
come
to
my
football
games
He
had
a
high-pressure
career
and
it
meant
driving
through
most
of
Friday
night
But
for
all
the
big
games
when
I
looked
over
at
the
sideline
there
was
that
familiar
fedora
And
by
God
did
the
opposing
team
captain
ever
get
a
firm
handshake
and
a
gaze
he
would
remember
Then
a
school
fact
contradicted
something
he
said
Impossible
that
he
could
be
wrong
but
there
it
was
in
the
book
These
accumulated
over
time
along
with
personal
experiences
to
buttress
my
own
developing
sense
of
values
And
I
could
tell
we
had
each
taken
our
own
perfectly
normal
paths
I
began
to
see
too
his
blind
spots
his
prejudices
and
his
weaknesses
I
never
threw
these
up
at
him
He
hadn't
to
me
and
anyway
he
seemed
to
need
protection
I
stopped
asking
his
advice
the
experiences
he
drew
from
no
longer
seemed
relevant
to
the
decisions
I
had
to
make
He
volunteered
advice
for
a
while
But
then
in
more
recent
years
politics
and
issues
gave
way
to
talk
of
empty
errands
and
always
to
ailments
From
his
bed
he
showed
me
the
many
sores
and
scars
on
his
misshapen
body
and
all
the
bottles
for
medicine
Sometimes
he
confided
I
would
just
like
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
not
wake
up
After
much
thought
and
practice
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
one
night
last
winter
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
and
remembered
for
an
instant
those
terrifying
dark
holes
in
another
house
35
years
before
I
told
my
fatherhow
much
I
loved
him
I
described
all
the
things
people
were
doing
for
him
But
I
said
he
kept
eating
poorly
hiding
in
his
room
and
violating
the
doctor's
orders
No
amount
of
love
could
make
someone
else
care
about
life
I
said
it
was
a
two-way
street
He
wasn't
doing
his
best
The
decision
was
his
He
said
he
knew
how
hard
my
words
had
been
to
say
and
how
proud
he
was
of
me
I
had
the
best
teacher
I
said
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
He
smiled
a
little
And
we
shook
hands
firmly
for
the
last
time
Several
days
later
at
about
4
A.M
my
mother
heard
Dad
shuffling
about
their
dark
room
I
have
some
things
I
have
to
do
he
said
He
paid
a
bundle
of
bills
He
composed
for
my
mother
a
long
list
of
legal
and
financial
what-to-do's
in
case
of
emergency
And
he
wrote
me
a
note
Then
he
walked
back
to
his
bed
and
laid
himself
down
He
went
to
sleep
naturally
And
he
did
not
wake
up
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial
Party
committees
have
created
detailed
policies
to
improve
their
working
style
as
required
by
the
country's
core
leadership
With
these
measures
Party
authorities
are
attempting
to
get
closer
to
the
public
experts

We
have
seen
lots
of
fresh
working
styles
from
the
newly
elected
Party
leaders
such
as
fewer
cliches
at
conferences
no
traffic
controls
during
inspection
tours
and
so
on
said
Zhu
Lijia
a
professor
of
public
administration
research
at
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Governance
But
Party
authorities
should
enhance
supervision
and
those
who
violate
regulations
should
be
punished

added
