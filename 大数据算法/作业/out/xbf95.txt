nearly
down
hill
Dad

and
several
years
not

such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
say
uncle
s
contribution
but
not
all
because
I
have
three
hundred
yuan
to
make
books
uncle
didn't
go
with
me
in
the
said
dad
before
he
has
not
called
me
to
junior
high
school
but
a
three

advised
me
to
give
up
reading
now
papa

a
part
of
my
books
I
read

say
to
their
credit
is
a
little
exaggerated
Father
left
home
also
no
rest
was
mother

mother's
grievance

while
the
father
was
annoyed

Dad

To

that
You

My
accusers
Mother
said

Mother
said
your
sister-in-law
also
said

not
believe

can
go

their
own
things
to

Later
my
father

do
not

have
to
confront
this
thing

But
the
father
and
mother
are
very
long
time
had
not
spoken
always
keep
silence
state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
very
so
stay
at
home
for
too
long
you
feel
so
lonely
and
boring
parents
also
I
have
no
job
but
feel
puzzled
think
it
over
and
over
again
had
no
friends
who
can
help
me
introduce
then
find
the
parents
remember
my
cousin
D
s
so
that
when
they
think
of
commissioned
sister-in-law
R's
called
D
took
me
to
the
city
to
work
F

located
on
the
edge
of
the
Fuchun
River
the
most
difficult
beautiful
county

also
my
hometown

center
Although
the
city
as
it
is
my
most
beautiful
dream
also
is
I
most
look
forward
to
come
to
one
of
the
city
but
because

economically
not
rich
or
because
I
was
in
the
city
without
known
relatives
so
only
stayed
in
the
countryside
most
lifetime
until
since
junior
high
school
lost
study

benefits
I
forced
to
quit
school
but
in
the
country
for
half
a
year

the
honor
to
the
D
s
lead
I
first
came
to
the
city
to
work
Since
D
s
hear
my
boring
at
home
after
the
state
he
was
in
the
very
next
day
morning
speeding
and
returned
to
his
hometown
urged
me
to
go
to
the
city
to
do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or
promises
probably
at
that
time
I
have
been
in
the
dream
of
the
life
in
the
city
there's
nothing
to
refuse
the
And

that
day

the
evening

while
sewing

of
a
hole
while
another

told
me
A
Cheng
You
have
never
been
to
the
city

must
listen
to
your
cousin's
arrangement
don't
go
out
on
a
night
out
that
will
make
your
brother
worry
will
let
us
worry
there
is
the
question
of
your
life
must
be
well
orderly
and
you
wear
and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother
and
friends
will
look
down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said
you
know
now
but
really
to
the
city
after
you
is
it
right
Our
words
as
unheeded
advice
that
an
inlet
and
an
outlet
to
forget
about
and
do
I
hope
you
not
if
you
so
dad
wouldn't
want
to
control
you
The
night
his
father
for
the
first
time
to
drink
is
also
the
first
time
that
I
drank
tincture
MOET
drunk
I
in
the
night
imperceptibly
in
wheezing
to
sleep
Early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
I
also
in
outdoor
breathe
fresh
air
waiting
for
mother
made
breakfast
eat
a
good
meal
with
my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also
can
Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or
accept
it
D's
said
rest
assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her
I
will
give
him
his
money
saved
in
the
home
My
father
put
the
money
back
pocket
looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
that
here
was
the
last
miss
that
my
heart
is
full
of
hope
full
of
ideals
is
my
nostalgia
reminds
me
of
the
beauty
of
my
hometown
As
tears
like
springs
that
my
surging
mood
as
in
heaven
so
here
swear
resolutely
obey
D's
command
I
went
to
Lake
source
direction
to
horse
sword
shift
car
went
straight
to
the
F
town
Go
forward
with
great
strength
and
vigour
to
the
F
city
F
City
we
in
the
long-distance
passenger
station
of
the
car
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
city
I
think
it's
great
it
is
because
I
first
saw
the
perfect
city
probably
for
the
city
people
the
city
is
not
big
because
there
are
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
such
as
Shanghai
Hangzhou
Nanjing
are
so
But
I
look
I
see
it
is
because
I
have
no
contact
with
the
city
and
the
first
contact
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
novelty
I
felt
that
here
is
my
dream
of
heaven
D
s
first
got
out
of
the
car
I
have
to
get
off
the
streets
together
with
him
I
don't
know
what
this
is
what
Lane
Road
always
feel
in
the
alley
as
in
gossip
so
I
feel
I
can't
touch
the
North
East
and
touched
the
East
has
touched
the
north
deeply
he
was
puzzled
When
I
came
to
a
river
river
sides
erected
a
high-rise
blocks
I
always
thought
that
this
is
the
Fuchun
River
I
really
think
you
saw
the
Fuchun
River
I
was
a
sigh
and
said
the
Fuchun
River
does
not
have
such
a
river
I
didn't
necessarily
it
big
D's
said
this
is
not
the
Fuchun
River
but
an
amaranth
Pujiang
I
said
oh
It
is
my
illusion
Words
I
am
his
behind
but
when
we
are
at
the
crossroads
in
the
middle
turn
right
this
is
a
long
hill
road
Liuzhou
Road
building
is
bristly
and
let
me
feel
the
perfect
city
economy
is
thriving
and
prosperous
each
poineering
hardships
may
make
it
difficult
to
imagine
as
I
came
to
a
world
came
to
a
childhood
