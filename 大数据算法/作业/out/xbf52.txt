life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
From
the
bright
sunlight
If
the
rain
from
the
cloud
Break
your
pride
Think
of
my
love
for
you
And
everything
shall
be
fine
Let
us
soar
let
us
fly
To
the
highest
height
And
everything
shall
be
fineLast
year
the
cancer
nearly
finished
me
off
However
with
the
accompaniment
of
my
best
friend
Candice
I
could
eventually
get
through
these
tough
time
Sometimes
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
always
stand
by
my
side
Last
summer
the
doctor
discovered
that
I
suffered
from
lung
cancer
At
that
moment
I
was
completely
shocked
All
memories
that
I
have
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
in
seconds
I
thought
I
was
going
to
leave
all
my
friends
my
family
and
all
people
I
loved
To
me
the
whole
world
was
just
sinking
Luckily
that
was
just
in
an
early
stage
and
the
doctor
said
that
I
had
I
great
chance
to
recover
after
a
series
of
treatments
But
he
warned
me
that
the
treatment
would
be
very
tough
and
painful
At
first
I
have
considered
to
refuse
the
treatment
However
after
I
have
though
about
all
of
my
valuable
friends
and
my
mom
and
dad
I
chose
to
take
the
chance
During
the
treatment
I
gradually
suffered
from
the
side
effects
The
number
of
hairs
on
my
head
declined
and
I
vomited
from
dawn
till
night
on
every
single
day
I
had
a
very
poor
appetite
and
I
nearly
had
no
desired
to
put
any
food
to
my
mouth
I
was
very
painful
and
I
was
thinking
about
giving
up
the
treatment
I
though
I
could
not
tolerate
it
anymore
However
with
the
support
and
encouragement
from
my
best
friend
Candice
I
have
eventually
made
it
through
the
rain
and
stand
up
once
again
Finally
I
recovered
One
summer
night
Candice
came
to
the
hospital
to
visit
me
We
sat
on
the
bench
that
facing
the
sea
The
sun
was
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
night
descended
We
chatted
underneath
the
stars
We
have
not
met
each
other
since
the
graduation
Candice
said
with
tears
on
her
face
Yes
I
have
never
thought
we
would
have
the
reunion
in
the
situation
I
said
She
kept
silent
with
her
tears
in
the
warm
gentle
breeze
We
have
been
best
friends
since
we
were
small
I
do
not
want
this
friendship
to
end
up
so
soon
She
cried
desperately
Zach
you
are
a
man
You
are
a
man
who
is
courageous
and
adventurous
You
should
have
that
guts
to
fight
for
your
life
and
people
around
you
But
Now
I
am
going
to
give
you
the
courage
you
need
She
lay
her
hand
on
me
Lord
please
give
this
little
boy
love
and
hope
to
face
the
obstacle
that
he
is
now
facing
Please
give
him
courage
to
help
him
to
find
the
way
Now
you
have
already
possessed
the
ability
to
fight
this
war
You
should
never
give
up
as
there
is
a
light
in
your
heart
and
shines
very
brightly
Since
them
I
understand
that
when
fate
is
tough
just
toughen
your
faith
With
a
smile
I
know
I
could
face
the
future
no
matter
what
lay
ahead
And
there's
a
hero
comes
along
with
the
strength
to
carry
on
My
dad
has
always
used
this
song
to
encourage
me
Until
he
passed
away
I
still
keep
this
song
in
my
iPod
and
listen
to
it
when
I
need
to
get
through
some
tough
time
To
me
this
song
does
not
only
symbolize
the
spirit
of
my
dad
but
also
mine
This
song
is
ubiquitous
in
various
singing
competitions
Regardless
of
its
singing
technique
the
beautiful
melody
and
those
meaningful
lyrics
has
helped
many
people
to
get
through
obstacles
This
fabulous
song
was
composed
by
American
singer-songwriter
Mariah
Carey
in
1993
and
definitely
performed
by
herself
The
song
mentioned
that
among
every
single
one
of
us
a
hero
lies
inside
our
heart
If
we
try
to
reach
into
our
soul
our
emptiness
will
disappear
There's
a
hero
if
you
look
inside
your
heart
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid
of
who
you
are
When
I
was
small
I
was
a
child
who
was
so
fragile
and
cried
easily
I
was
afraid
of
everything
I
was
so
this
and
small
and
when
my
classmates
bullied
me
all
I
would
do
was
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
and
cry
from
dawn
till
night
Worse
still
I
was
poor
in
academic
result
and
no
teachers
loved
me
On
these
days
I
found
myself
useless
and
believed
that
no
one
in
this
world
would
recognise
this
small
potato
I
was
so
desperate
Yet
in
one
dark
night
my
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
hand
was
so
large
and
warm
All
I
could
feel
was
the
love
and
hope
transmitted
through
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
and
to
my
heart
and
soul
Son
you
should
not
be
fragile
anymore
But
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
Now
I
am
going
to
recall
your
hero
from
your
soul
and
from
now
on
you
would
never
feel
lonely
anymore
My
hero
and
your
hero
have
already
stayed
together
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
Other
people
can
say
anything
they
want
to
say
Although
they
try
to
bring
you
down
you
will
never
allow
them
to
do
so
because
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
This
hero
will
always
stay
close
to
you
and
protect
you
forever
Afterwards
he
sang
this
song
to
me
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow
But
don't
let
anyone
to
tear
them
away
Since
then
whenever
I
need
to
face
any
problems
or
obstacles
alone
I
will
not
be
fragile
anymore
All
I
need
to
do
is
sing
Hero
along
with
my
hero
and
my
father's
hero
and
I
will
certainly
know
that
my
father
will
guide
me
where
I
should
go
I
know
that
there
is
a
light
in
me
and
shines
very
brightly
and
other
people
can
try
but
they
can
never
take
that
away
from
me
The
meeting
is
WangHai
Time
always
unknowingly
hurried
away
flash
Also
in
the
online
to
spend
a
few
years
Cry
also
laughed
Thousands
of
day
and
night
WangHai
roaming
A
thought
to
mature
Walk
to
the
friend
go
to
How
many
friends
already
not
disappear
Sitting
alone
in
the
space
is
cold
and
cheerless
Some
vague
sad
loss
Thankfully
Have
a
lot
of
friends
have
been
silent
about
Accompany
me
along
the
way
Always
buchibuqi
In
the
virtual
network
Deduce
true
feelings
Behind
the
screen
in
the
cold
And
each
wish
Whenever
the
birthday
Will
receive
blessings
of
friends
Very
often
I
moved
ShiXi
unceasingly
Thanks
friends
gifts
and
blessing
Because
of
you
Lonely
night
has
not
lonely
Because
of
you
My
birthday
is
not
cold
and
cheerless
Of
a
friend
said
I
am
not
alone
My
friend
Thousands
of
WanLiLi
just
a
moment
of
distance
Don't
need
name
also
need
not
face
Both
you
and
I
Thank
you
all
Those
Childhood
Days
When
you
came
into
the
world
she
held
you
in
her
arms
You
thanked
her
by
weeping
your
eyes
out
When
you
were
1
year
old
she
fed
you
and
bathed
you
You
thanked
her
by
crying
all
night
long
When
you
were
2
years
old
she
taught
you
to
