example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de
guerre
of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
Israel
The
U.S
Treasury
Department
has
also
slapped
financial
sanctions
against
two
men
it
believes
are
senior
leaders
in
the
militia
group
Maysar
Ali
Musa
Abdallah
al-Juburi
and
Anas
Hasan
Khattab
Recent
media
reports
also
mention
one
Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
to
bakeries
We
are
keeping
the
price
of
bread
at
15
lira
about
21
U.S
cents
which
was
its
true
price
Abu
Adnan
said
adding
that
transgressors
would
be
punished
according
to
Shari¡®a
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
also
thus
far
avoided
indiscriminate
civilian
casualties
That¡¯s
not
to
say
that
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
have
fierce
critics
especially
within
rebel
circles
In
addition
to
its
civilian
detractors
many
more
secular-minded
fighters
are
wary
of
the
group¡¯s
social
conservatism
but
insist
that
its
brand
of
ultraconservative
Islam
will
not
find
a
home
in
any
post-Assad
Syria
These
fighters
often
say
that
they
will
deal
with
conservative
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
later
but
that
right
now
they
need
them
in
the
fight
against
Assad
Other
rebels
view
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
a
transient
jihadi
group
that
will
move
onto
foreign
fronts
like
Afghanistan
or
Gaza
after
the
fall
of
Assad
Abu
Adnan
smirked
when
asked
to
comment
about
such
sentiments
especially
by
fellow
Sunni
fighters
whom
he
dismissed
as
the
brainwashed
He
repeated
that
the
idea
that
we
are
a
global
organization
or
that
we
have
some
other
goal
elsewhere
after
the
fall
is
not
true
He
was
emphatic
We
are
Syrians
He
admitted
that
we
also
have
foreigners
who
came
from
other
countries
but
he
explained
that
is
because
the
wounds
in
the
Arab
lands
are
the
same
wound
and
the
oppression
is
the
same
oppression
A
minute
I
always
feel
so
long
Think
of
me
and
your
chance
Less
and
less
as
if
by
the
end
of
life
We
separate
with
each
other
The
world
of
two
people
each
other
again
A
minute
I'm
drunk
wine
a
few
times
The
evening
of
that
day
I'm
a
night
did
not
return
you
want
to
A
minute
Appear
in
front
of
you
you
want
me
to
repent
But
time
constraints
no
waiting
a
minute
