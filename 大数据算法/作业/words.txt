It
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial
Party

for

commented
on
Wednesday
the

banning
the
U.S

to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive

of

Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
Users
shall
be
responsible
for
reclaiming
the

area
and
quality
of

land
they
use
for
construction
of
non-agricultural
projects
the
Land
Administration
Law
stipulates
Wang
Yunkun
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of
compensated
land
and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State
Council
or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens
or
hundreds
of
years
he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures
from
the
report
showed
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev

also
bans
U.S

on

They
added
that
large
B2C
platforms
such
as
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
are
set
to
strengthen
their
lead
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
have
gradually
become
the
driving
force
of
the
nation's
e-commerce
industry
replacing
the
customer-to-customer
model
represented
by

said
Chen

an

International
Turnover
in
the
country's
B2C
e-commerce
sector
is
projected
to
reach
470
billion
yuan
in

a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the
market
in
the
years

said
Chen
The
report
did
not
say
how
much
market
share
the
nation's
top
B2C
players
are
going
to
take
in
2013
In
November
Tmall
and
Jingdong

accounted
for
more
than
70
percent
of
visits
to
Web
pages
in
the
B2C
sector
according
to
data
from
Huihui.cn
an

Top
brick-and-mortar

operators
such

Suning

also
joined
the

said
the

Although
their
market
share
remains
small
compared
to
Tmall

Jingdong

the
traditional

online
operations
will
be
able
to
challenge

leaders
in

it
said
In
addition
the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's
e-commerce
industry
is
set
to
decline
in
the
coming
years
partly
because
retailers
will
find
it
is
harder
to
attract
new

Jingdong

pledged
to
explore
new

based
on

was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days

MOSCOW
Dec

Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans
on
U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against
Russians
abroad
and
persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take
effect
on
Jan
1
2013
if
signed
by

Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov

the
Moscow
police
have
detained
four

near
the
Federation

building
who
were
protesting
against
the
bill
Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
in
November
1989
All
member
states
are
obliged
to

in
the

the
best
interests

Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
Users
shall
be
responsible
for
reclaiming
the

the
Land
Administration
Law
stipulates
Wang
Yunkun
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of
compensated
land
and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State
Council
or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens
or
hundreds
of
years
he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures
from

researchers

on

They
added
that
large
B2C
platforms
such
as
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
are
set
to
strengthen
their
lead
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
have
gradually
become
the
driving
force
of
the
nation's
e-commerce
industry
replacing
the

model
represented

said
Chen

an

International
Turnover
in
the

B2C
e-commerce
sector
is
projected
to
reach
470
billion
yuan
in

a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the
market
in
the

said
Chen
The
report
did
not
say
how
much
market
share
the
nation's
top
B2C
players
are
going
to
take
in
2013
In

Tmall
and
Jingdong

accounted
for
more
than
70
percent
of
visits
to
Web
pages
in
the
B2C
sector
according
to
data
from
Huihui.cn
an

website
under

Top

operators
such

Although
their

remains
small

the

online

will
be
able
to

it

In

the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's
e-commerce
industry
is
set
to
decline
in
the
coming

partly
because
retailers
will
find
it
is
harder
to

had
more
than
600
000
specialized
farmer
cooperatives
covering
more
than
46
million
rural
households
or
18.6
percent
of
China's
total
rural
households
said
a
report
filed
to
the
Standing
Committee
of
the
National
People's
Congress
NPC
Through
specialized
cooperatives
farmers
engaging
in
the
same
kind
of
agricultural
production
are
able
to
pool
resources
together
and
make
more
money
with
cooperative
members
earning
20
percent
more
than
non-members
on
average
according
to
the
report
The
report
was
delivered
by
an
inspection
group
sent
by
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
earlier
this
year
to
survey
the
enforcement
of
the
country's
Agriculture
Law
and
other
related
government
policies
China
has
vowed
to
develop
specialized
cooperatives
and
joint
stock
partnerships
for
farmers
foster
new
types
of
agricultural
business
entities
and
develop
large-scale
agricultural
operations
in
diverse
formIt
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many

MOSCOW
Dec

Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans

U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against
Russians
abroad

persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted

2013
if

building
who
were
protesting
against
the

Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
in
November
1989
All
member
states
are
obliged

policies
in

the
best
interests

Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
Users
shall
be
responsible
for
reclaiming
the
same
area
and
quality
of
cultivated
land
they
use
for
construction
of
non-agricultural
projects
the
Land
Administration
Law
stipulates
Wang
Yunkun
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of
compensated
land
and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State
Council
or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens
or
hundreds
of
years
he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures
from

said
on
Dec
19
in
a

of
East
China's
Jiangsu

put
forward
a
10-item
regulation
on
Friday
requiring
each
provincial-level
official
to
spend
at

at
the
grassroots
level
and
eating
and
working

authority
said
Apart
from
the
provincial
Party

researchers
estimated
on
Wednesday
They
added
that
large
B2C
platforms
such
as
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
are
set
to
strengthen
their
lead
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
have
gradually
become
the
driving
force
of
the
nation's
e-commerce
industry
replacing
the
customer-to-customer
model
represented
by

an

International
Turnover
in
the
country's
B2C
e-commerce
sector
is
projected
to
reach
470
billion
yuan
in
2012
a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the
market
in
the
years
to
come
said
Chen
The
report
did
not
say
how
much
market
share
the
nation's
top
B2C
players
are
going
to
take
in
2013
In
November
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
accounted
for
more
than
70
percent
of
visits
to
Web
pages
in
the
B2C
sector
according
to
data
from
Huihui.cn
an
e-commerce
data
analysis
website
under

Top
brick-and-mortar

store
operators
such
as
Suning

also
joined
the

said
the

Although
their
market

remains
small
compared
to
Tmall

the
traditional

online
operations
will
be
able
to
challenge

leaders
in

it
said
In
addition
the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's
e-commerce
industry
is
set
to
decline
in
the
coming
years
partly
because
retailers
will
find
it
is
harder
to
attract
new

The

to

hospital
on

and

on

and
said
the
former
South

Mandela
was
also
admitted
to
hospital
in

because
of
abdominal
pain
but
released
the
following
day
after
a
keyhole
examination
showed
there

spent
most
of
his

since
then
in
another
home
in
Qunu
his
ancestral
village
in
the
impoverished
Eastern
Cape

His
poor
health
has
prevented
him
from
making
any

in

has
continued
to

A
religious
scholar
and
Shari¡®a
law
official
in
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
leadership
in
the
Aleppo
area
the
35-year-old
had
a
ready
answer
for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We
know
the
West
and
its
oppressive
ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N
Security
Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity
Smokers

A
potential
recruit
must
undertake
a
10-day
religious-training
course
to
ascertain
his
understanding
of
religion
his
morals
his
reputation
A
15-to-20-day
military-training
program
follows
That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
the
vehicle
including
Abu
Adnan
who
silently
approached
the
car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not
introduce
himself
until
I
asked
who
he
was
later
We
drove
to
a
small
cold
concrete
room
with
a
tiny
window
that
barely
let
in
any
light
from
an
already
overcast
sky
We
sat
among
boxes
of
long-life
milk
and
bags
of
blankets
and
winter
clothes
waiting
to
be
distributed
Our
host
the
driver
tried
to
start
a
portable
gas
heater
but
there
was
no
gas
America
has
called
us
terrorists
because
it
says
that
some
of
our
tactics
bear
the
fingerprints
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de
guerre
of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
Israel
The
U.S
Treasury
Department
has
also
slapped
financial
sanctions
against
two
men
it
believes
are
senior
leaders
in
the
militia
group
Maysar
Ali
Musa
Abdallah
al-Juburi
and
Anas
Hasan
Khattab
Recent
media
reports
also
mention
one
Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
toIt
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
again
until
it
was
firm
enough
As
time
passed
there
were
other
rules
to
learn
Always
do
your
best.""Do
it
now.""Never
lie
And
most
importantly
"You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
By
my
teens
he
wasn't
telling
me
what
to
do
anymore
which
was
scary
and
heady
at
the
same
time
He
provided
perspective
not
telling
me
what
was
around
the
great
corner
of
life
but
letting
me
know
there
was
a
lot
more
than
just
today
and
the
next
which
I
hadn't
thought
of
One
day
I
realize
now
there
was
a
change
I
wasn't
trying
to
please
him
so
much
as
I
was
trying
to
impress
him
I
never
asked
him
to
come
to
my
football
games
He
had
a
high-pressure
career
and
it
meant
driving
through
most
of
Friday
night
But
for
all
the
big
games
when
I
looked
over
at
the
sideline
there
was
that
familiar
fedora
And
by
God
did
the
opposing
team
captain
ever
get
a
firm
handshake
and
a
gaze
he
would
remember
Then
a
school
fact
contradicted
something
he
said
Impossible
that
he
could
be
wrong
but
there
it
was
in
the
book
These
accumulated
over
time
along
with
personal
experiences
to
buttress
my
own
developing
sense
of
values
And
I
could
tell
we
had
each
taken
our
own
perfectly
normal
paths
I
began
to
see
too
his
blind
spots
his
prejudices
and
his
weaknesses
I
never
threw
these
up
at
him
He
hadn't
to
me
and
anyway
he
seemed
to
need
protection
I
stopped
asking
his
advice
the
experiences
he
drew
from
no
longer
seemed
relevant
to
the
decisions
I
had
to
make
He
volunteered
advice
for
a
while
But
then
in
more
recent
years
politics
and
issues
gave
way
to
talk
of
empty
errands
and
always
to
ailments
From
his
bed
he
showed
me
the
many
sores
and
scars
on
his
misshapen
body
and
all
the
bottles
for
medicine
Sometimes
he
confided
I
would
just
like
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
not
wake
up
After
much
thought
and
practice
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
one
night
last
winter
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
and
remembered
for
an
instant
those
terrifying
dark
holes
in
another
house
35
years
before
I
told
my
fatherhow
much
I
loved
him
I
described
all
the
things
people
were
doing
for
him
But
I
said
he
kept
eating
poorly
hiding
in
his
room
and
violating
the
doctor's
orders
No
amount
of
love
could
make
someone
else
care
about
life
I
said
it
was
a
two-way
street
He
wasn't
doing
his
best
The
decision
was
his
He
said
he
knew
how
hard
my
words
had
been
to
say
and
how
proud
he
was
of
me
I
had
the
best
teacher
I
said
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
He
smiled
a
little
And
we
shook
hands
firmly
for
the
last
time
Several
days
later
at
about
4
A.M
my
mother
heard
Dad
shuffling
about
their
dark
room
I
have
some
things
I
have
to
do
he
said
He
paid
a
bundle
of
bills
He
composed
for
my
mother
a
long
list
of
legal
and
financial
what-to-do's
in
case
of
emergency
And
he
wrote
me
a
note
Then
he
walked
back
to
his
bed
and
laid
himself
down
He
went
to
sleep
naturally
And
he
did
not
wake
up
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial
Party
committees
have
created
detailed
policies
to
improve
their
working
style
as
required
by
the
country's
core
leadership
With
these
measures
Party
authorities
are
attempting
to
get
closer
to
the
public
experts
said
We
have
seen
lots
of
fresh
working
styles
from
the
newly
elected
Party
leaders
such
as
fewer
cliches
at
conferences
no
traffic
controls
during
inspection
tours
and
so
on
said
Zhu
Lijia
a
professor
of
public
administration
research
at
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Governance
But
Party
authorities
should
enhance
supervision
and
those
who
violate
regulations
should
be
punished

added
In
a
10-item
regulation
issued
on
Tuesday
the
Party
committee
of

China's
Xinjiang
Uygur
autonomous
region
said
that
reception
dinner
times
should
be
limited
to
less
than
45
minutes
in
government
agencies
According
to
the
regulation
the
autonomous

different
departments
are
not
allowed
to
treat
each
other
to
banquets
at
public
expense

The
Party
committee
of
Guizhou
province
vowed
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
development
of
organizations
at
the
grassroots
level
in
a
10-item
regulation
issued
recently
Provincial-level
officials
are
required
to
go
to
the
grassroots
level
more
frequently
to
listen
to
the
public
and
resolve
conflicts
Guizhou
Daily
reported
on
Monday
The
regulation
is
a
response
to
the
eight
measures
put
forward
this
month
by
the
newly
elected
central
leadership
of
the
Party
and
is
aimed
at
improving
the
Party's
working
style
cutting
extravagance
and
bureaucracy
and
bringing
leaders
closer
to
the
people
According
to
the
eight
measures
officials
should
reduce
bureaucratic
meetings
cut
spending
on
inspections
arrange
fewer
traffic
restrictions
and
eliminate
extravagant
welcoming
ceremonies
Many
provincial-level
Party
committees
have
already
made
efforts
to
implement
the
measures
When
government
leaders
and
main
Party
leaders
a
term
that
usually
refers
to
Party
chiefs
and
governors
visit
organizations
at
the
grassroots
level
there
should
be
less
than
five
municipal
officials
and
fewer
than
three
county
officials
the
Beijing
municipal
Party
committee
said
on
Dec
19
in
a
document
implementing
the
eight
measures
Beijing
municipal
officials
should
eat
at
a
buffet

Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans
on
U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against

abroad
and
persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa

and
asset

on
Russian
officials
thought

the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of

fraud
The
Russian

voted
unanimously
for
the

Act

the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as

sphere
The

is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take

the
Moscow
police
have
detained
four

building
who
were

Konstantin
Dolgov
the

Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human

commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
in
November
1989

Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the

area
of

is

Users
shall
be

Administration
Law
stipulates
Wang
Yunkun
an
NPC
Standing

member
voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of
compensated
land
and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State
Council
or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens
or
hundreds
of
years
he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures
from

are
set

strengthen

Tmall

have
gradually

of

in

in

a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the

in

not
say
how

share
the

Tmall

accounted
for
more

70
percent
of

to
Web
pages
in
the
B2C

according

from

Although

the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's

industry
is
set

decline
in

partly
because

We
expect
Egypt
to
continue
to
push
forward
its
orderly
political
transition
and
maintain
political
and
social
stability
An
atmosphere
of
crisis
has
deepened
in
Egypt
since
the
vote
with
many
Egyptians
rushing
to
withdraw
cash
from
banks
and
hoarding
hard
currency
savings
at
home
Adding
to
people's
concerns
the
authorities
have
imposed
currency
controls
to
prevent
capital

Leaving

Morsi
signed
a
decree
enforcing

late
on
Tuesday
after
the
official
announcement
of
the
result
of
a
referendum
approving
the
basic
law
Egypt's
first
constitution
since
Mubarak's
overthrow
The
text
has
sharpened
painful
divisions
in
the
Arab
world's
most
populous
nation
and
prompted
violent
protests
on
the
streets
of
Cairo
Opposition
groups
condemn
the
new
basic
law
as
too
Islamist
and
undemocratic
claiming
it
could
allow
clerics
to
intervene
in
the
lawmaking
process
and
leave
minority
groups
without
proper
legal
protection
But
Morsi

adopting
the
text
is
key

Mandela
has
a
history
of
lung
problems
dating
back
to
when
he
contracted
tuberculosis
while
in
jail
as
a
political
prisoner
He
spent
27
years
in
prison
including
18
years
on
the
windswept
Robben
Island
off
Cape
Town
The
former
president
was
admitted
to
a
Pretoria
hospital
on
December
8
and
this
was
his
longest
stay
in
hospital
since
he
was
released
from
prison
in
1990
Current
President
Jacob
Zuma
visited
Mandela
on
Christmas
Day
and
said
the
former
South
African
leader
was
doing
much
better
making
progress
and
in
good
spirits
Mandela
was
also
admitted
to
hospital
in
February
because
of
abdominal
pain
but
released
the
following
day
after
a
keyhole
examination
showed
there
was
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
him
He
has
spent
most
of
his
time
since
then
in
another
home
in
Qunu
his
ancestral
village
in
the
impoverished
Eastern
Cape
province
His
poor
health
has
prevented
him
from
making
any
public
appearances
in
the
past
two
years
although
he
has
continued
to
receive
high-profile
visitors
including
former
US
President
Bill
Clinton
earlier
this
year
Mandela
became
South
Africa's
first
black
president
after
the
country's
first
all-race
elections
in
1994
After
his
release
from
prison
he
used
his
popularity
to
push
for
reconciliation
between
whites
and
blacks
which
became
the
bedrock
of
the
post-apartheid
Rainbow
Nation
Mandela
stepped
down
as
president
in
1999
after
one
term
in
office
and
has
largely
been
absent
from
public
life
for
the
last
decade.Abu
Adnan
smirked
from
behind
his
black
balaclava
his
auburn
whiskers
peeking
through
the
fabric
as
the
corners
of
his
mouth
rose
A
religious
scholar
and
Shari¡®a
law
official
in
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
leadership
in
the
Aleppo
area
the
35-year-old
had
a
ready
answer
for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We
know
the
West
and
its
oppressive
ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N
Security
Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity
Smokers
need
not
apply
A
potential
recruit
must
undertake
a
10-day
religious-training
course
to
ascertain
his
understanding
of
religion
his
morals
his
reputation
A
15-to-20-day
military-training
program
follows
That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
the
vehicle
including
Abu
Adnan
who
silently
approached
the
car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not
introduce
himself
until
I
asked
who
he
was
later
We
drove
to
a
small
cold
concrete
room
with
a
tiny
window
that
barely
let
in
any
light
from
an
already
overcast
sky
We
sat
among
boxes
of
long-life
milk
and
bags
of
blankets
and
winter
clothes
waiting
to
be
distributed
Our
host
the
driver
tried
to
start
a
portable
gas
heater
but
there
was
no
gas
America
has
called
us
terrorists
because
it
says
that
some
of
our
tactics
bear
the
fingerprints
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de
guerre
of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
Israel
The
U.S
Treasury
Department
has
also
slapped
financial
sanctions
against
two
men
it
believes
are
senior
leaders
in
the
militia
group
Maysar
Ali
Musa
Abdallah
al-Juburi
and
Anas
Hasan
Khattab
Recent
media
reports
also
mention
one
Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
to
bakeries
We
are
keeping
the
price
of
bread
at
15
lira
about
21
U.S
cents
which
was
its
true
price
Abu
Adnan
said
adding
that
transgressors
would
be
punished
according
to
Shari¡®a
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
also
thus
far
avoided
indiscriminate
civilian
casualties
That¡¯s
not
to
say
that
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
have
fierce
critics
especially
within
rebel
circles
In
addition
to
its
civilian
detractors
many
more
secular-minded
fighters
are
wary
of
the
group¡¯s
social
conservatism
but
insist
that
its
brand
of
ultraconservative
Islam
will
not
find
a
home
in
any
post-Assad
Syria
These
fighters
often
say
that
they
will
deal
with
conservative
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
later
but
that
right
now
they
need
them
in
the
fight
against
Assad
Other
rebels
view
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
a
transient
jihadi
group
that
will
move
onto
foreign
fronts
like
Afghanistan
or
Gaza
after
the
fall
of
Assad
Abu
Adnan
smirked
when
asked
to
comment
about
such
sentiments
especially
by
fellow
Sunni
fighters
whom
he
dismissed
as
the
brainwashed
He
repeated
that
the
idea
that
we
are
a
global
organization
or
that
we
have
some
other
goal
elsewhere
after
the
fall
is
not
true
He
was
emphatic
We
are
Syrians
He
admitted
that
we
also
have
foreigners
who
came
from
other
countries
but
he
explained
that
is
because
the
wounds
in
the
Arab
lands
are
the
same
wound
and
the
oppression
is
the
same
oppression
A
minute
I
always
feel
so
long
Think
of
me
and
your
chance
Less
and
less
as
if
by
the
end
of
life
We
separate
with
each
other
The
world
of
two
people
each
other
again
A
minute
I'm
drunk
wine
a
few
times
The
evening
of
that
day
I'm
a
night
did
not
return
you
want
to
A
minute
Appear
in
front
of
you
you
want
me
to
repent
But
time
constraints
no
waiting
a
minute
Is
the
morning
you
find
I'm
a
night
that
night
Who
knows
in
the
noon
time
I
am
the
soft
bed
happy
to
sleep
But
you
have
to
use
a
minute
Wake
me
up
the
rumble
of
the
scolded
I
feel
very
feel
shy
When
I
want
to
take
a
minute
to
make
up
But
you
never
give
me
a
chance
And
you
say
we
are
the
best
choice
to
leave
I
used
a
few
years
time
Build
a
charming
scenery
wall
And
now
you
say
collapse
will
collapse
I'm
unwilling
heart
want
to
take
a
minute
To
redeem
my
fault
I
beg
you
said
to
me
Not
I
do
not
give
you
the
opportunity
But
given
the
opportunity
you
have
to
cherish
So
we
each
other
to
leave
for
good
That
night
the
minutes
But
it
doesn't
make
you
took
from
my
dreams
May
the
minute
for
you
Is
already
in
the
past
for
me
A
minute
is
an
indelible
scar
Forever
in
your
heart

The
nine
seven
half
of
the
year
I
graduated
from
the
primary
school
took
more
than
two
months
holiday
oneself
in
boring
boring
nothing
for
me
to
do
Probably
because
I
was
in
primary
school
has
over
two
times
the
level
or
that
I
was
in
the
primary
school
stage
without
ambition
my
result

them
disappointed
disappointed
again
in
helpless
situation
teachers
do
not
stay
in
my
class
From
the
beginning
to
repeat
things
because
be
informed
parents
I
have
the
opinion
very
much
but
that
s
not
for
me
to
say
but
parents
and
teachers
say
so
in
the
two
years
younger
than
I
classmates
together
side
by
side
I
was
very
uncomfortable
psychological
also
feel
very
guilty
Only
this
guilt
and
inner
pain
no
one
can
imagine
Then
to
the
junior
high
school
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
neighborhood
folks
have
advised
me
not
to
read
so
I
went
to
town
to
work
I
seem
to
be
somewhat
unwilling

to
their
opinions
and
think
of

not

me
feel
very
afraid
so
I
read
no
matter
how
bad
but
also
to
the
nine
year
compulsory
education
school
But
I
think

from
that
time
I

Book
habits
mother's
good
at
saying
you
read
a
book
are
admitted
to
a
university
so
you
really
go
to
read
a
book
you
don't
read
I
was
so
mom
a
nag
well
I
hate
to
take
all
of
the
book
to
burn
My
graduation
exam
is
over
a
long
time
I
didn't
know
how
to
grade
their
own
have
been
waiting
when
my
anxiety
to
fifth
days
at
the

time

not

I
can
not

out
their
performance
is

or

not
over
the
admission
notice
I
was
happy
but
when
the
notice
it
but
found
that
there
was
no
money
at
home
for
me
to
read
and
I
feel
it
This
day
Friday

and
left
me
and
my
mother

Father
outside

very
hard
a
week
later
did
not
wait
for
the
dad
who
come
back
home
I
was
boring
occasionally
also
help
mother
do
some
housework
but
most
of
the
time
I
am
a
person
sits
on
the
bed
or
on
the
wheelchair
When
I
was
home
to
sit
to
uncle
home
to
flow
because
the
uncle's
path
is
the
only
way
which
must
be
passed
on
the
junior
high
school
so
when
the
school
in
the
school
I'll
be
watching
them
back
and
forth
it
seems
that
I'm
reading
way

not
give
up
Father
borrow
money
did
not
come
back
but
the
family
tattle
and
prate
much
rise
when
aunt

my
ears
ago
often
nag
daddy
thing
I
feel
creepy
why
is
it
so
Dad

Dad
You

back
You

back
quickly
I
prefer
not
to
read
will
not
let
you
be
such
grievances
such
insults
Dad
Dad
What
are
you
Why
are
they
so
say
you
I
have
been
to
have
been
waiting
for
his
return
Aunt
said
your
father
too
do
bad
name
that
he
do
it
really
lost
your
face
For
a
start
I
don't
know
what
happened
the
mood
is
very
heavy
asked
aunt
how
Is
there
anything
so
so
serious
Aunt
aggravated
by
an
angry
tone
said
your
father
outside
in
order
to
give
you
borrow
books
first
to
your
aunt's
house
he
said
the
home
to
buy
cattle
need
to
borrow
money
so
aunt
to
know
no
such
thing
so
don't
borrow
To
the
ancient
city
of
leaf
Tingjia
your
father's
friends
said
to
buy
chemical
fertilizer
to
borrow
a
little
money
Tingjia
leaves
no
he
will
go
to
your
grandma's
house
to
you
two
uncle's
house
to
borrow
your
dad
said
is
to
build
a
house
your
uncle
happened
to
encounter
village
grow
there
ask
he
once
topic
was
exposed
he
had
to
go
to
Ningbo
and
the
town
of
Evergreen
s
aunt
s
home
to
borrow
they
have
had
to
go
to
Shangjie
discussed
In
fact
I
was
really
want
to
ask
why
he
did
know
go
to
Ningbo
to
evergreen
all
be
crystal
clear
isn't
he
is
immortal
But
I
think
if
I
really
ask
those
words
do
not
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
again
I
heard
a
few
times
she
simply
said
you
don't
read
simply
go
out
work
I
thought
if
Dad
comes
back
I
can't
read
but
sometimes
I
am
unwilling
heart
no
matter
what
was
advised
in
the
school
I
had
a
few
lessons
can
comfort
my
soul
As
for
the
aunt's
words
I
don't
want
to
hear
but
also
do
not
want
to
use
it
The
school
school
for
several
days
Dad
Don't
see
at
that
time
I
was
a
little
worried
but
those
tattle
and
prate
is
not
stopped
but
also
the
diffusion
constant
at
While
I
thought
in
my
mind
my
father
come
back
and
side
wanted
dad
to
lend
money
to
come
back
I
can
take
a
good
read
I
do
not
want
to
give
up
all
of
a
sudden
but
to
no
avail
since
the
tattle
and
prate
my
heart
was
tortured
to
death
Mom
In
addition
to
complaining
that
father
outside
sometimes
also
want
to
talk
to
scold
me
maybe
she
more
recently
than
I
was
upset
so
she
wants
to
say
I
she
said
to
me
and
I
don't
chew
sound
One
day
I
went
to
his
aunt's
house
because
the
boring
to
my
aunt's
house
behind
the
bamboo
inside
to
digging
up
bamboo
shoots
when
I
really
dig
vigorously
suddenly
heard
the
mother's
cry
I
came
down
to
see
his
aunt
said
Daddy
things
let
s
lose
face
so
my
mother
sometimes
hard
to
explain
for
oneself
sometimes
feel
helpless
because
she
feels
she
jumped
into
the
the
Yellow
River
wash
not
clear
so
she
felt
wronged
cry
In
fact
say
mother
instigated
is
possible
the
key
is
my
own
request
forcing
the
father
in
the
back
of
the
eternal
infamy
to
say
in
the
final
analysis
is
my
fault
so
I
ought
to
I
heard
my
mother
weeping
I
also
feel
very
sad
This
a
few
days
later
mother's
mood
has
not
been
good
if
not
more
I
see
my
mother
like
this
is
very
worried
After
a
few
days
of
school
another
week
has
passed
I
also
miss
dad
Don't
know
Dad
outside
doing
may
be
I
worry
most
X
x
on
the
evening
the
sun
nearly
down
hill
Dad
came
back
I
go
first
call
dad
like
my
father
and
several
years
not
to
meet
such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
say
uncle
s
contribution
but
not
all
because
I
have
three
hundred
yuan
to
make
books
uncle
didn't
go
with
me
in
the
said
dad
before
he
has
not
called
me
to
junior
high
school
but
a
three
again
three
advised
me
to
give
up
reading
now
papa
got
money
made
a
part
of
my
books
I
read
to
say
to
their
credit
is
a
little
exaggerated
Father
left
home
also
no
rest
was
mother
shouted
did
mother's
grievance
venting
gas
while
the
father
was
annoyed
do
not
know
to
whom
to
tell
he
ll
go
Mother
said
you
come
The
money
for
you
to
cheat
here
Oh
So
good
people
like
you
fool
money

go
begging
Dad
shouted
who
said
that
To
who
said
that
You
give
me
a
call
My
accusers
Mother
said
without
confrontation
the
village
has
spread
to
open
You

the
village
to
make
inquiries
will
know
You're
so
listen
to
them
they
have
so
good
Dad
said
Mother
said
your
sister-in-law
also
said
do
not
believe
you
can
go
and
ask
him
do
their
own
things
to
know
Later
my
father
also
do
not
know
to
have
to
confront
this
thing
Buleerle
But
the
father
and
mother
are
very
long
time
had
not
spoken
always
keep
silence
state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
very
so
stay
at
home
for
too
long
you
feel
so
lonely
and
boring

I
have
no
job
but
feel
puzzled
think
it
over
and
over
again

no
friends
who
can
help
me

Although
the

most
look
forward
to
come
to
one
of
the
city
but
because

because

me
to
go

do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or

at
that
time
I
have
been
in

cousin's
arrangement

is
the
question
of
your
life

be
well
orderly
and
you
wear
and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother

down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said

now
but

the
city
after
you

it
right
Our
words

and
an
outlet

about
and
do

hope
you
not

to

my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also
can
Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or
accept
it
D's
said
rest
assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her
I
will
give
him
his
money
saved
in
the
home
My
father
put
the
money
back
pocket
looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
that
here
was
the
last
miss
that
my
heart
is
full
of
hope
full
of
ideals
is
my
nostalgia
reminds
me
of
the
beauty
of
my
hometown
As
tears
like
springs
that
my
surging
mood
as
in
heaven
so
here
swear
resolutely
obey
D's
command
I
went
to
Lake
source
direction
to
horse
sword
shift
car
went
straight
to
the
F
town
Go
forward
with
great
strength
and
vigour
to
the
F
city
F
City
we
in
the
long-distance
passenger
station
of
the
car
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
city
I
think
it's
great
it
is
because
I
first
saw
the
perfect
city
probably
for
the
city
people
the
city
is
not
big
because
there
are
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
such
as
Shanghai
Hangzhou
Nanjing
are
so
But
I
look
I
see
it
is
because
I
have
no
contact
with
the
city
and
the
first
contact
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
novelty
I
felt
that
here
is
my
dream
of
heaven
D
s
first
got
out
of
the
car
I
have
to
get
off
the
streets
together
with
him
I
don't
know
what
this
is
what
Lane
Road
always
feel
in
the
alley
as
in
gossip
so
I
feel
I
can't
touch
the
North
East
and
touched
the
East
has
touched
the
north
deeply
he
was
puzzled
When
I
came
to
a
river
river
sides
erected
a
high-rise
blocks
I
always
thought
that
this
is
the
Fuchun
River
I
really
think
you
saw
the
Fuchun
River
I
was
a
sigh
and
said
the
Fuchun
River
does
not
have
such
a
river
I
didn't
necessarily
it
big
D's
said
this
is
not
the
Fuchun
River
but
an
amaranth
Pujiang
I
said
oh
It
is
my
illusion
Words
I
am
his
behind
but
when
we
are
at
the
crossroads
in
the
middle
turn
right
this
is
a
long
hill
road
Liuzhou
Road
building
is
bristly
and
let
me
feel
the
perfect
city
economy
is
thriving
and
prosperous
each
poineering
hardships
may
make
it
difficult
to
imagine
as
I
came
to
a
world
came
to
a
childhood
paradise
I
see
a
paradise
of
dream
in
my
nose
to
dazzle
along
the
road
of
hill
of
dragon
of
the
past
it
is
a
city
surrounded
by
people
in
and
out
of
the
mall
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
in
the
commercial
city
upstairs
to
write
the
Fuchun
River
commercial
city
it
seems
like
I
know
this
is
F
the
city's
most
bustling
shopping
center
the
most
bustling
sidewalks
I
just
want
to
say
the
city
of
F
F
really
great
I
came
to
this
strange
city
I
really
feel
in
this
strange
city
I
can
absorb
your
sunny
temperament
to
be
a
city
that
the
giants
I
am
going
to
show
themselves
When
I
didn't
see
enough
outside
downtown
scene
I
was
D's
to
the
commercial
city
there
are
all
the
stalls
food
stands
above
the
green
vegetables
eggplant
garlic
onion
bean
curd
a
kind
sister
church
where
D's
stall
led
me
here
and
sister
chatted
a
while
when
the
elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
is
to
eat
lunch
saw
us
big
brother
put
down
his
chopsticks
call
us
to
sit
down
then
O
O
said
A
Cheng
Your
dinner

had
dinner
yet
I
haven't
answered
D's
for
I
said
we
have
no
Big
brother
says
here
to
eat
not
home
to
burn
She
also
said
yes
Or
here
to
eat
even
home
to
burn
much
trouble
D's
said
not
so
polite
home
to
burn
it
it
didn't
take
long
very
fast
He
made
the
remarks
at
the
same
time
I
still
look
around
because
I
see
here
is
such
a
big
stall
is
also
the
first
time
saw
so
many
dishes
people
buy
vegetable
stall
So
my
curiosity
in
here
is
not
fun
When
I
put
the
spirit
are
concentrated
in
the
food
stalls
of
things
he
finished
on
the
go
I'm
still
hazy
a
bit
at
a
loss
situation
he
said
to
me
A
Cheng
we
go
I
didn't
hear
there
is
one
point
be
absent-minded
look
he
coaxed
out
of
said
hello
What's
on
your
mind
Told
you
so
loudly
did
not
hear
Go
I
said
oh
Elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
to
pick
some
fresh
vegetables
let
you
bring
us
back
to
cook
he
and
I
left
sister
they
couple
booth
then
to
another
butcher
shop
stall
bought
several
kilograms
of
meat
left
the
commercial
city
and
imperceptibly
and
through
a
Malaysian
Road
came
to
a
named
Zhou
Jianong
lane
across
the
alley
alley
went
to
D's
house
D's
house
is
an
underground
garage
inside
a
very
the
smell
is
also
important
I
very
want
to
move
out
but
I
will
not
economic
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
environment
here
it
is
the
parents
of
thousand
exhort
enjoin
let
I
firmly
remember
them
you
want
me
to
listen
to
D's
so
I
had
to
reluctantly
stay
When
I
walked
inside
the
heat
from
the
outside
directly
to
heaven
so
I
really
feel
it's
hard
I
am
afraid
went
into
the
furnace
of
the
house
let
me
really
angry
be
ashamed
of
dying
When
I
was
in
the
hot
sun
dried
by
the
sun
at
the
same
time
D's
said
why
don't
you
come
in
Quickly
Wash
dishes
I
went
to
go
say
to
him
it
is
too
hot
I
have
a
bit
of
a
bear
D's
continued
hot
A
fan
Do
not
be
afraid
of
heat
a
long
time
to
get
over
I
come
too
but
we
insist
on
the
stand
A
man
should
be
afraid
of
tired
we
are
so
out
of
practice
I
said
oh
Came
to
give
him
food
finished
lunch
he's
out
let
me
have
a
rest
at
home
for
a
day
starting
tomorrow
I
promised
D's
a
boring
also
have
a
look
at
the
room
television
occasionally
to
bring
home
the
story
books
doubled
the
old
warm
up
in
primary
and
secondary
schools
the
residual
reading
difficulty
One
day
in
the
imperceptibly
in
the
past
soon
arrived
at
dusk
D's
also
returned
to
cook
I
don't
know
how
to
cook
so
there
are
a
lot
of
housework
is
D's
one
person
to
complete
I
can
only
one
wash
dishes
clean
the
room
health
or
what
other
are
not
good
At
night
after
dinner
D's
and
I
had
to
watch
TV
in
bed
TV
also
is
no
good
program
I
watched
a
imperceptibly
fell
asleep
Suddenly
I
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
I
will
readily
but
here
I
can
not
find
the
toilet
was
anxious
to
panic
I
find
that
I
finally
find
convenient
corner
when
I
finished
returned
was
a
patrol
car
through
here
I
was
found
by
police
as
a
thief
was
caught
The
car
out
of
the
two
patrol
to
check
my
ID
card
I
came
to
the
interior
from
my
bag
show
identity
cards
to
give
them
they
took
out
the
register
put
my
name
and
identity
card
number
is
recorded
in
it
and
again
and
again
I
ask
my
family
and
address
then
they
contact
D
s
asked
his
identity
asked
his
work
address
information
is
very
detailed
and
they
have
put
D
s
identity
as
a
pledge
export
to
a
television
set
let
him
leave
the
TV
invoice
and
specifications
to
verify
can
put
his
things
he
returned
to
the
He
had
to
accept
to
let
them
D's
until
the
patrol
had
gone
he
said
how
can
you
not
carefully
let
the
guard
discovered
I
said
I
don't
know
How
do
I
know
the
night
police
so
fiercely
knew
that
I
wouldn't
back
out
D's
continued
next
to
a
sharp
point
don't
be
so
idiotic
Know
or
not
Said
oh
Know
Put
out
the
light
then
we
sleep
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
sleep
at
night
because
the
room
was
at
night
is
also
very
difficult
to
eliminate
unless
the
outside
temperature
drops
to
the
upper
20s
degrees
after
midnight
there
may
be
more
comfortable
Wake
up
the
first
thing
I
do
is
to
wash
brush
work
then
I
put
a
few
of
the
ash
bucket
and
a
large
shovels
and
in
D
s
back
leading
me
to
play
first
In
fact
I
don't
know
what
is
hard
what
is
helpless
life
I
have
not
try
at
home
parents
regard
me
as
a
saint
as
for
at
that
time
I
feel
so
blessed
and
now
I
can
only
obey
D's
leadership
as
his
apprentice
I
came
to
the
city
gates
then
turn
to
the
Old
Road
South
Gate
Street
South
Gate
Street
rely
on
the
Fuchun
River
and
that
a
large
river
it
is
the
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
we
stand
position
is
the
Fuchun
River
ferry
terminal
just
because
it
is
against
the
direction
of
the
city
to
the
South
so
it
means
draw
road
also
known
as
South
Gate
Street
near
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
I
came
here
did
not
look
at
the
moon
not
here
on
vacation
trip
or
something
I
was
just
a
young
worker
come
to
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
many-storied
buildings
work
most
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
river
I
and
it
are
not
fate
I
climbed
to
the
six
floor
of
this
building
opened
the
door
there
are
several
woodworking
early
start
working
here
their
decoration
process
of
half
I
come
here
only
a
toilet
and
a
wing
not
paved
tiles
This
is
D
s
and
I
started
to
do
it
My
first
day
at
work
is
to
carry
cement
bag
or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too
much
I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
is
D
s
wake
me
from
this
dream
urged
me
to
go
to
work
I
mistily
mistily
to
get
up
go
to
work
work
on
the
path
of
two
feet
in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a
little
be
petrified
like
How
can
I
not
to
mention
the
spirit
Seems
to
me
the
wholeEven
if
more
magnificent
rhetoric
Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk
the
voice
Beat
the
floor
Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me
babble
learn
language
I
learned
to
language
in
the
river
The
first
word-mom
How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only
for
repel
mosquitoes
Breeze
send
me
to
sleep
But
regardless
of
the
eyebrows
climb
sweat
poured
Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite
write
of
word
Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
and
vertical
dignified
and
imposing
You
said
that
a
man
have
to
like
it
Young
i
was
not
sensible
Occasionally
make
a
mistake
You
taught
me
the
force
of
justice
I
keep
in
mind
your
word
Dare
not
have
a
bit
slight
In
order
to
build
a
quiet
environment
for
my
studies
The
already
heavy
burden
of
the
family
You
take
on
all
the
housework
and
farm
work
Even
if
was
too
tired
to
take
a
breath
Also
won't
let
me
take
part
in
I
was
moved
to
nothing
to
say
In
my
memory
You've
never

coin
You

what
is
bitter
What

On

Youth
at
a
loss
You

to
me

and
drabs
And
give
me
all
of
the
analysis
and
directions
I
like
the
blind
man
to
regain
the
light
when
injustice
and
resentment
All
the
world
don't
understand
me
Only
you
know
me
In
you
here
I
got
the
light
when
faced
with
the
choices
I
hesitate
to
stray
around
You

me

But
you
won¡¯t

Because

it's
just
accompany
you
to
dinner
Even
if
it's
just
wash
the
dishes
for
you
We
are
very
glad
to
do
it
Dear
mom
to
your
gratitude
Always
talk
very
much
Let
me
in
this
beautiful
season
Once
again
cry
out
Mom
I
love
you
Wish
you
have
a
good
health
And
happy
every
dayHas
been
that
a
man
hiding
in
the
side
to
steal
cry
age
has
been
the
world
runs
age
has
not
remember
from
when
to
begin
planning
for
the
future
imagine
the
life
don't
remember
from
what
time
to
worry
more
and
more
I
started
back
to
have
a
look
their
growth
path
one
every
day
watching
I
alone
posture
standing
on
the
roadside
inserted
his
hands
in
pants
I
see
countless
people
from
my
side
deadpan
passed
by
they
came
on
with
the
coffee
holding
a
drink
take
the
textbook
with
mobile
phone
They
be
in
a
hurry
to
depart
put
me
off
like
an
idle
about
Occasionally
someone
stopped
smiled
at
me
I
know
these
people
stay
down
is
the
warmth
of
my
life
they
will
never
abandon
I
care
be
the
source
of
my
life
Guo
Jingming
said
my
friends
are
my
courage
to
live
and
they
give
me
your
ability
let
me
face
this
world
no
longer
panic
Those
who
have
and
be
crazy
with
me
with
sadness
with
cycling
through
the
thin
youth
friend
I
think
we
all
remember
the
youth
is
how
we
face
cannot
erase
the
traces
Xiao
chen
went
to
Hainan
in
a
dessert
shop
as
dessert
Whenever
we
have
a
vacation
will
be
received
her
phone
call
she
received
the
text
message
she
always
likes
to
write
very
long
As
it
was
she
knew
I
was
a
very
insecure
afraid
to
lose
even
if
there
is
no
important
will
also
write
a
long
message
let
me
know
her
by
my
side
never
leave
Chen
is
a
very
clever
girl
but
in
the
study
does
not
enlighten
after
each
test
there
will
always
be
that
her
poor
grades
in
my
front
side
into
my
mouth
ice
cream
a
begged
me
to
help
her
with
We
have
been
together
for
9
years
so
only
a
piece
of
memory
I
always
thought
she
was
a
bright
child
happy
and
simple
life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
From
the
bright
sunlight
If
the
rain
from
the
cloud
Break
your
pride
Think
of
my
love
for
you
And
everything
shall
be
fine
Let
us
soar
let
us
fly
To
the
highest
height
And
everything
shall
be
fineLast
year
the
cancer
nearly
finished
me
off
However
with
the
accompaniment
of
my
best
friend
Candice
I
could
eventually
get
through
these
tough
time
Sometimes
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
always
stand
by
my
side
Last
summer
the
doctor
discovered
that
I
suffered
from
lung
cancer
At
that
moment
I
was
completely
shocked
All
memories
that
I
have
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
in
seconds
I
thought
I
was
going
to
leave
all
my
friends
my
family
and
all
people
I
loved
To
me
the
whole
world
was
just
sinking
Luckily
that
was
just
in
an
early
stage
and
the
doctor
said
that
I
had
I
great
chance
to
recover
after
a
series
of
treatments
But
he
warned
me
that
the
treatment
would
be
very
tough
and
painful
At
first
I
have
considered
to
refuse
the
treatment
However
after
I
have
though
about
all
of
my
valuable
friends
and
my
mom
and
dad
I
chose
to
take
the
chance
During
the
treatment
I
gradually
suffered
from
the
side
effects
The
number
of
hairs
on
my
head
declined
and
I
vomited
from
dawn
till
night
on
every
single
day
I
had
a
very
poor
appetite
and
I
nearly
had
no
desired
to
put
any
food
to
my
mouth
I
was
very
painful
and
I
was
thinking
about
giving
up
the
treatment
I
though
I
could
not
tolerate
it
anymore
However
with
the
support
and
encouragement
from
my
best
friend
Candice
I
have
eventually
made
it
through
the
rain
and
stand
up
once
again
Finally
I
recovered
One
summer
night
Candice
came
to
the
hospital
to
visit
me
We
sat
on
the
bench
that
facing
the
sea
The
sun
was
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
night
descended
We
chatted
underneath
the
stars
We
have
not
met
each
other
since
the
graduation
Candice
said
with
tears
on
her
face
Yes
I
have
never
thought
we
would
have
the
reunion
in
the
situation
I
said
She
kept
silent
with
her
tears
in
the
warm
gentle
breeze
We
have
been
best
friends
since
we
were
small
I
do
not
want
this
friendship
to
end
up
so
soon
She
cried
desperately
Zach
you
are
a
man
You
are
a
man
who
is
courageous
and
adventurous
You
should
have
that
guts
to
fight
for
your
life
and
people
around
you
But
Now
I
am
going
to
give
you
the
courage
you
need
She
lay
her
hand
on
me
Lord
please
give
this
little
boy
love
and
hope
to
face
the
obstacle
that
he
is
now
facing
Please
give
him
courage
to
help
him
to
find
the
way
Now
you
have
already
possessed
the
ability
to
fight
this
war
You
should
never
give
up
as
there
is
a
light
in
your
heart
and
shines
very
brightly
Since
them
I
understand
that
when
fate
is
tough
just
toughen
your
faith
With
a
smile
I
know
I
could
face
the
future
no
matter
what
lay
ahead
And
there's
a
hero
comes
along
with
the
strength
to
carry
on
My
dad
has
always
used
this
song
to
encourage
me
Until
he
passed
away
I
still
keep
this
song
in
my
iPod
and
listen
to
it
when
I
need
to
get
through
some
tough
time
To
me
this
song
does
not
only
symbolize
the
spirit
of
my
dad
but
also
mine
This
song
is
ubiquitous
in
various
singing
competitions
Regardless
of
its
singing
technique
the
beautiful
melody
and
those
meaningful
lyrics
has
helped
many
people
to
get
through
obstacles
This
fabulous
song
was
composed
by
American
singer-songwriter
Mariah
Carey
in
1993
and
definitely
performed
by
herself
The
song
mentioned
that
among
every
single
one
of
us
a
hero
lies
inside
our
heart
If
we
try
to
reach
into
our
soul
our
emptiness
will
disappear
There's
a
hero
if
you
look
inside
your
heart
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid
of
who
you
are
When
I
was
small
I
was
a
child
who
was
so
fragile
and
cried
easily
I
was
afraid
of
everything
I
was
so
this
and
small
and
when
my
classmates
bullied
me
all
I
would
do
was
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
and
cry
from
dawn
till
night
Worse
still
I
was
poor
in
academic
result
and
no
teachers
loved
me
On
these
days
I
found
myself
useless
and
believed
that
no
one
in
this
world
would
recognise
this
small
potato
I
was
so
desperate
Yet
in
one
dark
night
my
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
hand
was
so
large
and
warm
All
I
could
feel
was
the
love
and
hope
transmitted
through
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
and
to
my
heart
and
soul
Son
you
should
not
be
fragile
anymore
But
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
Now
I
am
going
to
recall
your
hero
from
your
soul
and
from
now
on
you
would
never
feel
lonely
anymore
My
hero
and
your
hero
have
already
stayed
together
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
Other
people
can
say
anything
they
want
to
say
Although
they
try
to
bring
you
down
you
will
never
allow
them
to
do
so
because
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
This
hero
will
always
stay
close
to
you
and
protect
you
forever
Afterwards
he
sang
this
song
to
me
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow
But
don't
let
anyone
to
tear
them
away
Since
then
whenever
I
need
to
face
any
problems
or
obstacles
alone
I
will
not
be
fragile
anymore
All
I
need
to
do
is
sing
Hero
along
with
my
hero
and
my
father's
hero
and
I
will
certainly
know
that
my
father
will
guide
me
where
I
should
go
I
know
that
there
is
a
light
in
me
and
shines
very
brightly
and
other
people
can
try
but
they
can
never
take
that
away
from
me
The
meeting
is
WangHai
Time
always
unknowingly
hurried
away
flash
Also
in
the
online
to
spend
a
few
years
Cry
also
laughed
Thousands
of
day
and
night
WangHai
roaming
A
thought
to
mature
Walk
to
the
friend
go
to
How
many
friends
already
not
disappear
Sitting
alone
in
the
space
is
cold
and
cheerless
Some
vague
sad
loss
Thankfully
Have
a
lot
of
friends
have
been
silent
about
Accompany
me
along
the
way
Always
buchibuqi
In
the
virtual
network
Deduce
true
feelings
Behind
the
screen
in
the
cold
And
each
wish
Whenever
the
birthday
Will
receive
blessings
of
friends
Very
often
I
moved
ShiXi
unceasingly
Thanks
friends
gifts
and
blessing
Because
of
you
Lonely
night
has
not
lonely
Because
of
you
My
birthday
is
not
cold
and
cheerless
Of
a
friend
said
I
am
not
alone
My
friend
Thousands
of
WanLiLi
just
a
moment
of
distance
Don't
need
name
also
need
not
face
Both
you
and
I
Thank
you
all

mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left
Thomas
Carlyle
lived
from
1795
until
1881
He
was
a
10000

Scot
essayist
and
historian
During
his
lifetime
he
became
one
of
the
world's
greatest
writers
But
he
was
a
human
and

On

1826

Carlyle
married
his
secretary
Jane
Welsh
She
was
an
intelligent
attractive
and
somewhat
temperamental
daughter
of
a
well-to-do
doctor
They
had
their
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
but
still
loved
Bathroom
Vanities
each
other
dearly
After
their
marriage
Jane
continued
to
serve
as
his
secretary
But
after
several
years
of
marriage
Jane
became
ill
Being
Bathroom
Mirrors
a
hard
worker
Carlyle
became
so
absorbed
in
his
writings
that
he
let
Jane
continue
working
for
several
weeks
after
she
became
ill
She
had
cancer
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
slow
growing
kind
she
finally
became
confined
to
her
bed
Although
Carlyle
loved
her
Bathroom
Accessories
dearly
he
very
seldom
found
time
to
stay
with
her
long
He
was
busy
with
his
work
when
Jane
died
they
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
for
the
service
The
day
Glass
Basin
was
a
miserable
day
It
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
Following
the
funeral
Carlyle
went
back
to
his
home
He
was
taking
it
pretty
hard
He
went
up
the
stairs
to
Jane's
room
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
her
bed
He
sat
there
thinking
Shower
Enclosures
about
how
little
time
he
had
spent
with
her
and
wishing
so
much
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
differently
Noticing
her
diary
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
picked
it
up
and
began
to
steel
shelving
read
it
Suddenly
he
seemed
shocked
He
saw
it
There
on
one
page
she
had
written
Interior
Doors
a
single
line
Yesterday
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
and
it
was
like
heaven
I
love
him
so
Something
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
He
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
that
he
meant
so
much
to
her
He
thought
of
all
wow
gold
australia
the
times
he
had
gone
about
his
work
without
thinking
about
and
noticing
her
Then
Carlyle
turned
the
page
in
the
diary
There
he
noticed
she
racking
had
written
some
words
that
broke
his
heart
I
have
listened
all
day
to
hear
his
steps
in
the
hall
but
now
it
is
late
and
I
guess
he
won't
come
today
Carlyle
read
a
little
more
in
the
book
Then
he
threw
it
down
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Some
of
his
friends
found
him
at
the
grave
his
buy
wow
gold
australia
face
buried
in
the
mud
His
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
Tears
continued
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
He
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
If
I
had
only
known
if
I
had
only
known
But
it
was
too
late
for
Carlyle
She
was
dead
After
Jane's
death
Carlyle
made
world
of
warcraft
gold
for
sale
little
attempt
to
write
again
The
historians
say
he
lived
another
15
years
weary
bored
and
a
partial
recluse
I
share
the
story
with
in
the
hope
that
you
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
While
our
loved
ones
must
have
the
money
we
make
to
live
it
is
the
love
we
have
that
they
really
want
Give
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
It
is
not
easy
to
define
what
kind
of
meaning
to
the
enterprise
culture
because
the
enterpise
culture
stems
from
the
ration
and
reality
which
should
be
related
to
the
regulations
or
how
to
react
to
the
risk
of
management
or
market
instead
of
just
focusing
on
training
and
meeting
which
should
be
related
to
the
proportion
of
thoughts
of
belonging
to
our
company
and
benefitting
our
company
in
the
difficulty
Sometimes
the
puzzled
people
are
always
in
the
mess
of
understanding
of
why
the
itemized
regulations
could
not
optimize
the
operation
and
not
regulate
the
action
of
some
officials
who
always
abused
the
power
to
benefit
themselves
which
lead
to
the
argument
that
as
long
as
the
company
is
so
large
that
the
culture
of
enterprise
is
absolutly
difficult
to
be
built
up
Different
people
with
different
education
background
and
different
comprehension
of
society
would
not
be
integrated
to
the
common
recognition
of
enterprise
culture
which
is
the
crux
to
help
the
company
be
prosperous
In
spite
of
training
many
officials
there
are
lots
of
bottlenecks
which
should
be
smoothed
and
holes
which
should
be
covered
so
we
must
work
out
some
measures
to
make
our
company
step
on
the
right
road
Regulations
are
parts
of
the
enterprise
culture
making
the
road
straight
but
what
kind
of
regulations
are
suitful
to
the
state-owned
company
The
regulation
are
always
eroded
by
dereliction
and
are
not
always
strickly
implemented
by
some
departments
Frankly
speaking
the
enterprise
culture
is
just
having
some
aspects
in
consciousness
frequently
dominating
the
behavior
which
would
give
us
some
reference
on
how
to
enact
the
detailed
regulations
could
get
the
return
as
expected
The
most
important
thing
related
to
the
enterprise
culture
is
how
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
in
the
every
respect
of
operation
We
must
detail
every
process
of
how
to
control
the
cost
and
how
to
make
the
work
efficient
and
rational
If
employee
could
make
their
regulations
rooted
in
mind
they
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
keep
them
from
dereliction
and
would
try
their
best
to
devote
the
wisdom
to
benifitting
our
company.For
example
The
flaws
in
human
nature
and
the
shortage
of
wealth
would
seduce
the
officals
to
accept
the
secret
money
from
agencies
who
are
intended
to
pull
down
the
officals
by
all
kinds
of
tactics
and
if
the
officals
are
too
fragile
to
resist
the
gifts
they
would
be
united
with
agencies
to
cheat
our
company
so
the
task
which
brooks
no
delay
is
the
education
brainwashing
and
making
the
severe
punishment
happen
without
them
the
enterprise
culture
is
like
the
moon
in
water
like
the
flowers
in
mist
like
the
stupid
being
called
clever
What
is
the
quintessence
of
the
enterprise
culture
It
is
easy
or
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
conclusion
because
it
is
a
hard
job
to
change
people¡¯s
mindset
which
is
always
in
the
prejustice.So
at
first
we
must
scrutinize
the
origin
of
the
prejustice
why
are
so
many
people
always
just
negating
others
because
we
are
extremely
lack
of
communication
to
understand
with
each
other
lacking
of
wisdom
to
tell
the
right
and
the
wrong
lacking
of
the
wide
chest
to
tolerate
the
different
ideas
wnich
lead
to
misunderstand
among
people
and
to
form
the
impasse
to
flexibly
resolve
the
thorny
problem.There
are
some
words
similar
and
implicated
with
the
word
culture
in
dictionary
such
as
communication
concoct
cooperation
coordination
copartner
control¡±
giving
us
some
metaphor
or
euphemism
that
enterprise
culture
must
depend
on
the
communication
cooperation
must
control
the
ridiculous
behavior
of
some
officials
must
concoct
the
atmosphere
from
stiff
suffocated
environment
to
the
active
creative
philosophical
philanthropic
state
of
mindset
of
everyone.But
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
behavior
spontaneously
follow
the
bright
side
of
human
being
just
because
of
the
fragile
and
selfish
nature
of
people
with
some
ignorant
knowledge
about
themselves
so
using
the
regulations
to
control
the
devil
in
their
mindset
and
encouraging
the
bold
attitude
to
resolve
the
present
and
history
problem
is
the
essential
way
of
making
the
enterprise
culture
alive
and
giving
the
light
to
the
employee
We
must
change
the
thoughts
that
we
are
isolated
by
others
we
are
just
living
for
ourself
we
are
just
focusing
on
our
private
cases
to
the
thoughts
that
if
we
can
help
each
other
if
we
believe
in
the
philosophy
of
strengthenning
the
consciousness
of
doing
the
job
positively
and
wisely
getting
good
return
we
can
achieve
the
goal
of
making
our
company
profitful
and
competitive
even
making
our
life
happy
Why
are
the
employee
always
having
no
enthusiasm
and
lacking
of
a
little
responsibility
in
their
job?why
are
there
lots
of
complaint
in
our
company?why
are
the
talented
people
resigning
quickly
from
our
company?Yes
the
salary
is
the
key
and
having
no
feeling
in
cooperation
unity
belonging
and
having
not
the
promising
future
are
the
fundamental
reasons
which
steamrollerred
the
spirit
to
be
loyal
to
company
so
putting
the
importance
of
employee
in
priority
is
the
way
of
having
the
high
competition
in
this
globallized
world
A
healthy
company
is
the
one
that
urgently
need
the
creative
advices
from
employee
in
stead
of
closing
their
eyes
filling
in
their
ears
in
front
of
the
employee
who
may
have
some
profound
and
pragmatic
ideas
which
maybe
benifit
to
the
operation
of
our
company.But
how
to
distinguish
the
good
ideas
or
the
wrong
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
leaders
who
must
look
through
everything
including
themselves
and
others
adding
that
they
must
comprehend
the
logic
of
mindset
and
behavior
of
themself
To
be
leaders
the
open
attitude
is
the
good
way
to
rationalize
the
management
adopting
the
positive
way
to
eliminate
the
flaws
in
the
structure
and
to
attain
the
goal
with
attacking
the
black
hands¡±
instead
of
always
being
in
defensive
measure
of
healing
the
fissure
in
management
that
is
deficient
in
courage
and
wisdom.It
is
also
one
part
of
the
enterprise
culture.Frankly
saying
having
good
return
to
our
company
is
dominated
by
the
fate
by
the
hearts
of
all
employee
by
the
regulations
by
the
rational
philosophy
by
the
authentic
wisdom
Service
is
the
culture
it
sounds
like
simple
but
complicated
and
profound
if
you
want
to
make
it
better
and
better
How
to
do
service
is
the
important
culture
of
enterprise
which
could
attract
many
people
to
take
our
flights
again
and
again.We
can
ask
a
simple
question
that
if
you
look
up
to
see
the
twinkled
stars
in
night
what
make
you
comfortable?The
answer
is
easy
the
bright
the
color
make
you
feel
comfortable
which
can
make
us
have
some
comprehension
that
if
you
make
people¡¯s
body
such
as
eye
ear
limbs
nose
heart
feel
nice
your
service
is
the
nice
service
if
you
make
the
customers
angry
you
failed
in
doing
service.So
you
must
think
over
how
to
make
the
customers
feel
better
is
the
best
way
to
learn
how
to
give
service
to
these
arrogant
and
hypercritical
customers
Above
all
We
can
understand
that
if
you
have
regulations
in
your
mindset
which
sometimes
is
selfish
and
Out
of
my
window
the
darkness
gave
me
a
signal:if
you
are
habitted
in
the
darkness
of
heart
you
would
be
dissappionted
for
ever.sometimes
I
want
to
find
the
way
of
making
me
in
the
positive
attitude
to
the
life
but
always
are
beated
by
my
experiences
which
cutted
off
the
robe
attached
to
the
sunshine.but
the
frustrated
happenning
is
not
the
domination
which
converts
my
good
intention
to
the
devil
the
domination
is
my
thoughts
which
are
sometimes
not
superficial
but
profound
gives
me
the
light
and
warm
to
live
simply
and
happily
What
kind
of
thoughts
would
release
my
pressure
and
gives
me
the
ability
to
survive
in
the
chilly
and
choppy
reality
which
would
distort
the
heart
fragile
to
the
fragmentary
condition
or
make
the
heart
wisom
strong
get
the
meaning
of
life
which
would
push
me
to
the
heaven
with
lots
of
beauty
and
full
I
would
say
that
my
thoughts
is
related
to
the
thoughts
themselves
if
you
can
change
the
thoughts
quickly
and
correctedly
you
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
pusure
the
objects
you
want;if
you
are
stubborn
enough
you
would
be
easily
defeated
by
the
fate
which
urgently
need
the
wisdom
light
to
cover
the
black
in
the
mindset
full
of
good
and
evil
When
I
was
a
child
I
do
not
know
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
and
have
no
faith
which
would
comfort
my
soul
to
give
me
a
light
would
direct
my
road
to
the
tranquillized
home
My
pressure
is
from
my
family
where
my
father
is
not
a
reasonable
person
and
had
no
ideas
on
how
to
cultivate
my
individual
personality
and
my
character
so
in
the
long
time
I
felt
the
life
of
mine
is
in
hell
even
if
I
have
food
to
eat
have
cloth
to
wear
but
my
heart
was
in
deep
frustration
and
had
much
hatre
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
shaping
my
thoughts
that
the
life
had
not
power
to
lift
me
from
the
miserable
conditions.after
long
long
time
the
climate
has
been
changed
to
more
warm
the
rivers
have
been
changed
to
more
polluted
the
hearts
of
many
people
have
been
changed
by
desire
for
money
to
be
vicious
my
god
has
given
me
the
enlight
that
if
you
can
comprehend
the
love
the
truth
you
can
have
sheft
below
the
sunshine
which
would
fill
you
and
warm
you
so
it
is
my
fortunation
I
can
get
the
hints
from
god
giving
me
the
truth
which
fattened
my
twisted
raods
in
the
mist
and
I
can
smile
happily
and
never
be
frustrated
again
Even
if
I
explain
the
understanding
of
love
and
truth
again
and
again
lots
of
people
still
had
lof
of
question
on
my
comprehension
about
the
thoughts
as
same
as
my
past.in
my
past
I
was
puzzled
intensifiedly
on
some
meaningful
words.some
people
said
to
me
the
words
wisdom
but
it
is
like
a
fool
who
can
not
distinguish
what
is
right
or
wrong
I
am
delayed
to
understand
the
truth
which
stumbled
my
existence
and
made
me
fall
to
hell.but
the
darkness
is
not
always
having
no
light
maybe
my
god
has
pity
on
me
one
day
I
found
thoughts
can
change
my
action
my
attitude
to
the
life
I
confronted
that
is
in
the
embarrassed
condition.after
I
have
been
changed
to
the
peace
life
by
the
fresh
way
of
thinking
I
can
in
confidence
make
a
conclusion
that
please
believing
in
the
god¡¯s
soul
that
tell
you
what
is
yours
what
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
this
world
worthy
pusuring
you
should
love
should
dent
the
suffering
you
have
got
and
smiling
in
the
darkness
stubborn
and
everyone
would
follow
the
regulations
rooted
in
your
heart
thinking
of
the
company
as
your
own
our
enterprise
would
be
promising.The
safety
and
service
is
the
crux
to
our
enterprise
we
must
strengthen
our
consciousness
to
keep
them
in
our
mind
and
do
our
best
to
support
it
VIRTUE
is
like
a
rich
stone
best
plain
set
and
surely
virtue
is
best
in
a
body
that
is
comely
though
not
of
delicate
features
and
that
hath
rather
dignity
of
presence
than
beauty
of
aspect
Neither
is
it
almost
seen
that
very
beautiful
persons
are
otherwise
of
great
virtue
as
if
nature
were
rather
busy
not
to
err
than
in
labor
to
produce
excellency
And
therefore
they
prove
accomplished
but
not
of
great
spirit
and
study
rather
behavior
than
virtue
But
this
holds
not
always
for
Augustus
Caesar
Titus
Vespasianus
Philip
le
Belle
of
France
Edward
the
Fourth
of
England
Alcibiades
of
Athens
Ismael
the
Sophy
of
Persia
were
all
high
and
great
spirits
and
yet
the
most
beautiful
men
of
their
times
In
beauty
that
of
favor
is
more
than
that
of
color
and
that
of
decent
and
gracious
motion
more
than
that
of
favor
That
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
cannot
express
no
nor
the
first
sight
of
the
life
There
is
no
excellent
beauty
that
hath
not
some
strangeness
in
the
proportion
A
man
cannot
tell
whether
Apelles
or
Albert
Durer
were
the
more
trifler
whereof
the
one
would
make
a
personage
by
geometrical
proportions
the
other
by
taking
the
best
parts
out
of
divers
faces
to
make
one
excellent
Such
personages
I
think
would
please
nobody
but
the
painter
that
made
them
Not
but
I
think
a
painter
may
make
a
better
face
than
ever
was
but
he
must
do
it
by
a
kind
of
felicity
as
a
musician
that
maketh
an
excellent
air
in
music
and
not
by
rule
A
man
shall
see
faces
that
if
you
examine
them
part
by
part
you
shall
find
never
a
good
and
yet
altogether
do
well
If
it
be
true
that
the
principal
part
of
beauty
is
in
decent
motion
certainly
it
is
no
marvel
though
persons
in
years
seem
many
times
more
amiable
pulchrorum
autumnus
pulcher
for
no
youth
can
be
comely
but
by
pardon
and
considering
the
youth
as
to
make
up
the
comeliness
Beauty
is
as
summer
fruits
which
are
easy
to
corrupt
and
cannot
last
and
for
the
most
part
it
makes
a
dissolute
youth
and
an
age
a
little
out
of
countenance
but
yet
certainly
again
if
it
light
well
it
maketh
virtue
shine
and
vices
blush
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
It
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything

Cleveland
Indian's

running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake

again
and
again
until
it
was
firm
enough
As
time
passed
there
were
other
rules
to
learn
Always
do
your
best.""Do
it
now.""Never
lie
And
most
importantly
"You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
By
my
teens
he
wasn't
telling
me
what
to
do
anymore
which
was
scary
and
heady
at
the
same
time
He
provided
perspective
not
telling
me
what
was
around
the
great
corner
of
life
but
letting
me
know
there
was
a
lot
more
than
just
today
and
the
next
which
I
hadn't
thought
of
One
day
I
realize
now
there
was
a
change
I
wasn't
trying
to
please
him
so
much
as
I
was
trying
to
impress
him
I
never
asked
him
to
come
to
my
football
games
He
had
a
high-pressure
career
and
it
meant
driving
through
most
of
Friday
night
But
for
all
the
big
games
when
I
looked
over
at
the
sideline
there
was
that
familiar
fedora
And
by
God
did
the
opposing
team
captain
ever
get
a
firm
handshake
and
a
gaze
he
would
remember
Then
a
school
fact
contradicted
something
he
said
Impossible
that
he
could
be
wrong
but
there
it
was
in
the
book
These
accumulated
over
time
along
with
personal
experiences
to
buttress
my
own
developing
sense
of
values
And
I
could
tell
we
had
each
taken
our
own
perfectly
normal
paths
I
began
to
see
too
his
blind
spots
his
prejudices
and
his
weaknesses
I
never
threw
these
up
at
him
He
hadn't
to
me
and
anyway
he
seemed
to
need
protection
I
stopped
asking
his
advice
the
experiences
he
drew
from
no
longer
seemed
relevant
to
the
decisions
I
had
to
make
He
volunteered
advice
for
a
while
But
then
in
more
recent
years
politics
and
issues
gave
way
to
talk
of
empty
errands
and
always
to
ailments
From
his
bed
he
showed
me
the
many
sores
and
scars
on
his
misshapen
body
and
all
the
bottles
for
medicine
Sometimes
he
confided
I
would
just
like
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
not
wake
up
After
much
thought
and
practice
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
one
night
last
winter
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
and
remembered
for
an
instant
those
terrifying
dark
holes
in
another
house
35
years
before
I
told
my
fatherhow
much
I
loved
him
I
described
all
the
things
people
were
doing
for
him
But
I
said
he
kept
eating
poorly
hiding
in
his
room
and
violating
the
doctor's
orders
No
amount
of
love
could
make
someone
else
care
about
life
I
said
it
was
a
two-way
street
He
wasn't
doing
his
best
The
decision
was
his
He
said
he
knew
how
hard
my
words
had
been
to
say
and
how
proud
he
was
of
me
I
had
the
best
teacher
I
said
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
He
smiled
a
little
And
we
shook
hands
firmly
for
the
last
time
Several
days
later
at
about
4
A.M
my
mother
heard
Dad
shuffling
about
their
dark
room
I
have
some
things
I
have
to
do
he
said
He
paid
a
bundle
of
bills
He
composed
for
my
mother
a
long
list
of
legal
and
financial
what-to-do's
in
case
of
emergency
And
he
wrote
me
a
note
Then
he
walked
back
to
his
bed
and
laid
himself
down
He
went
to
sleep
naturally
And
he
did
not
wake
up
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial
Party
committees
have
created
detailed
policies
to
improve
their
working
style
as
required
by
the
country's
core
leadership
With
these
measures
Party
authorities
are
attempting
to
get
closer

the
public
experts
said
We
have
seen
lots
of
fresh
working
styles
from
the
newly
elected
Party
leaders
such
as
fewer
cliches
at
conferences
no
traffic
controls
during
inspection
tours

Zhu
Lijia

professor
of

administration
research

But
Party
authorities
should
enhance
supervision

violate
regulations
should
be
punished

who
said
their
grueling
campaign

And
that¡¯s
my

a
hug
I

I
think
you

MOSCOW
Dec
26
Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans
on
U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against
Russians
abroad
and
persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take
effect
on
Jan
1
2013
if
signed
by
the
president
into
law
Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov
told
local
media
Wednesday
that
Putin
would
consider
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
within
two
weeks
after
the
Federation
Council
approved
it
The
State
Duma
or
lower
house
of
the
parliament
on
Friday
passed
the
bill

the

Members

made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State

report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top

for

Lu
Yongxiang
vice

of

NPC
Standing

suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore

boost
both

Wang

an

Standing

voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of

and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State

or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens

he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing

said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the

to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the

of

as
is

He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures
from
the
report
showed
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa

on
Russian
officials

death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev

which
also
bans
U.S

from
adopting

is
named
after

According

a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the

witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C

with
large

set

dominate
the

how

the

the
report
estimated
that
the

rate
of
China's

industry
is

in

partly

community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity
Smokers
need
not
apply
A
potential
recruit
must
undertake
a
10-day
religious-training
course
to
ascertain
his
understanding
of
religion
his
morals
his
reputation
A
15-to-20-day
military-training
program
follows
That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
the
vehicle
including
Abu
Adnan
who
silently
approached
the
car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not
introduce
himself
until
I
asked
who
he
was
later
We
drove
to
a
small
cold
concrete
room
with
a
tiny
window
that
barely
let
in
any
light
from
an
already
overcast
sky
We
sat
among
boxes
of
long-life
milk
and
bags
of
blankets
and
winter
clothes
waiting
to
be
distributed
Our
host
the
driver
tried
to
start
a
portable
gas
heater
but
there
was
no
gas
America
has
called
us
terrorists
because
it
says
that
some
of
our
tactics
bear
the
fingerprints
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de
guerre
of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
Israel
The
U.S
Treasury
Department
has
also
slapped
financial
sanctions
against
two
men
it
believes
are
senior
leaders
in
the
militia
group
Maysar
Ali
Musa
Abdallah
al-Juburi
and
Anas
Hasan
Khattab
Recent
media
reports
also
mention
one
Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
to
bakeries
We
are
keeping
the
price
of
bread
at
15
lira
about
21
U.S
cents
which
was
its
true
price
Abu
Adnan
said
adding
that
transgressors
would
be
punished
according
to
Shari¡®a
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
also
thus
far
avoided
indiscriminate
civilian
casualties
That¡¯s
not
to
say
that
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
have
fierce
critics
especially
within
rebel
circles
In
addition
to
its
civilian
detractors
many
more
secular-minded
fighters
are
wary
of
the
group¡¯s
social
conservatism
but
insist
that
its
brand
of
ultraconservative
Islam
will
not
find
a
home
in
any
post-Assad
Syria
These
fighters
often
say
that
they
will
deal
with
conservative
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
later
but
that
right
now
they
need
them
in
the
fight
against
Assad
Other
rebels
view
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
a
transient
jihadi
group
that
will
move
onto
foreign
fronts
like
Afghanistan
or
Gaza
after
the
fall
of
Assad
Abu
Adnan
smirked
when
asked
to
comment
about
such
sentiments
especially
by
fellow
Sunni
fighters
whom
he
dismissed
as
the
brainwashed
He
repeated
that
the
idea
that
we
are
a
global
organization
or
that
we
have
some
other
goal
elsewhere
after
the
fall
is
not
true
He
was
emphatic
We
are
Syrians
He
admitted
that
we
also
have
foreigners
who
came
from
other
countries
but
he
explained
that
is
because
the
wounds
in
the
Arab
lands
are
the
same
wound
and
the
oppression
is
the
same
oppression
A
minute
I
always
feel
so
long
Think
of
me
and
your
chance
Less
and
less
as
if
by
the
end
of
life
We
separate
with
each
other
The
world
of
two
people
each
other
again
A
minute
I'm
drunk
wine
a
few
times
The
evening
of
that
day
I'm
a
night
did
not
return
you
want
to
A
minute
Appear
in
front
of
you
you
want
me
to
repent
But
time
constraints
no
waiting
a
minute
Is
the
morning
you
find
I'm
a
night
that
night
Who
knows
in
the
noon
time
I
am
the
soft
bed
happy
to
sleep
But
you
have
to
use
a
minute
Wake
me
up
the
rumble
of
the
scolded
I
feel
very
feel
shy
When
I
want
to
take
a
minute
to
make
up
But
you
never
give
me
a
chance
And
you
say
we
are
the
best
choice
to
leave
I
used
a
few
years
time
Build
a
charming
scenery
wall
And
now
you
say
collapse
will
collapse
I'm
unwilling
heart
want
to
take
a
minute
To
redeem
my
fault
I
beg
you
said
to
me
Not
I
do
not
give
you
the
opportunity
But
given
the
opportunity
you
have
to
cherish
So
we
each
other
to
leave
for
good
That
night
the
minutes
But
it
doesn't
make
you
took
from
my
dreams
May
the
minute
for
you
Is
already
in
the
past
for
me
A
minute
is
an
indelible
scar
Forever
in
your
heart
the
brand
mark
The
nine
seven
half
of
the
year
I
graduated
from
the
primary
school
took
more
than
two
months
holiday
oneself
in
boring
boring
nothing
for
me
to
do
Probably
because
I
was
in
primary
school

over
two
times

that
I
was
in
the
primary
school
stage
without

From

I
have
the
opinion
very
much
but
that
s
not

but
parents
and

so
in
the
two
years
younger
than
I
classmates
together
side
by
side
I
was
very
uncomfortable
psychological
also
feel
very
guilty
Only
this
guilt
and
inner
pain
no
one
can
imagine
Then
to
the
junior
high
school
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
neighborhood
folks
have
advised
me
not
to
read
so
I
went
to

to
work
I
seem
to
be
somewhat

afraid
so
I
read
no

how
bad
but
also

And
from
that
time
I
love
to

a
Book
habits
mother's
good
at
saying
you
read
a
book
are
admitted
to
a
university
so
you
really
go
to
read
a
book
you
don't
read
I
was
so
mom
a
nag
well
I
hate
to
take
all
of
the
book
to
burn
My
graduation
exam
is
over
a
long
time
I
didn't
know
how
to
grade
their
own
have
been
waiting
when
my
anxiety
to
fifth
days
at
the
same
time
the

to
can
not

I
can
not
find
out
their
performance
is

or

not
over
the
admission
notice
I
was
happy
but
when
the
notice
it
but
found
that
there
was
no
money
at
home
for
me
to
read
and
I
feel
it
This
day
Friday

and
left
me
and
my
mother

Father
outside

very
hard
a
week
later
did
not
wait
for
the
dad
who
come
back
home
I
was
boring
occasionally
also
help
mother
do
some
housework
but
most
of
the
time
I
am
a
person
sits
on
the
bed
or
on
the
wheelchair
When
I
was
home
to
sit
to
uncle
home
to
flow
because
the
uncle's
path
is
the
only
way
which
must
be
passed
on
the
junior
high
school
so
when
the
school
in
the
school
I'll
be
watching
them
back
and
forth
it
seems
that
I'm
reading
way
does
not
give
up
Father
borrow
money
did
not
come
back
but
the
family
tattle
and
prate
much
rise
when
aunt

my
ears
ago
often
nag

thing
I
feel
creepy
why
is
it
so
Dad

Dad
You

back
You

back
quickly
I
prefer
not
to
read
will
not
let
you
be
such
grievances
such
insults
Dad
Dad
What
are
you
Why
are
they
so
say
you
I
have
been
to
have
been
waiting
for
his
return
Aunt
said
your
father
too
do
bad
name
that
he
do
it
really
lost
your
face
For
a
start
I
don't
know
what
happened
the
mood
is
very
heavy
asked
aunt
how
Is
there
anything
so
so
serious
Aunt
aggravated
by
an
angry
tone
said
your
father
outside
in
order
to
give
you
borrow
books
first
to
your
aunt's
house
he
said
the
home
to
buy
cattle
need
to
borrow
money
so
aunt
to
know
no
such
thing
so
don't
borrow
To
the
ancient
city
of
leaf
Tingjia
your
father's
friends
said
to
buy
chemical
fertilizer
to
borrow
a
little
money
Tingjia
leaves
no
he
will
go
to
your
grandma's
house
to
you
two
uncle's
house
to
borrow
your
dad
said
is
to
build
a
house
your
uncle
happened
to
encounter
village
grow
there
ask
he
once
topic
was
exposed
he
had
to
go
to
Ningbo
and
the
town
of
Evergreen
s
aunt
s
home
to
borrow
they
have
had
to
go
to
Shangjie
discussed
In
fact
I
was
really
want
to
ask
why
he
did
know
go
to
Ningbo
to
evergreen
all
be
crystal
clear
isn't
he
is
immortal
But
I
think
if
I
really
ask
those
words
do
not
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
again
I
heard
a
few
times
she
simply
said
you
don't
read
simply
go
out
work
I
thought
if
Dad
comes
back
I
can't
read
but
sometimes
I
am
unwilling
heart
no
matter
what
was
advised
in
the
school
I
had
a
few
lessons
can
comfort
my
soul
As
for
the
aunt's
words
I
don't
want
to
hear
but
also
do
not
want
to
use
it
The
school
school
for
several
days
Dad
Don't
see
at
that
time
I
was
a
little
worried
but
those
tattle
and
prate
is
not
stopped
but
also
the
diffusion
constant
at
While
I
thought
in
my
mind
my
father
come
back
and
side
wanted
dad
to
lend
money
to
come
back
I
can
take
a
good
read
I
do
not
want
to
give
up
all
of
a
sudden
but
to
no
avail
since
the
tattle
and
prate
my
heart
was
tortured
to
death
Mom
In
addition
to
complaining
that
father
outside
sometimes
also
want
to
talk
to
scold
me
maybe
she
more
recently
than
I
was
upset
so
she
wants
to
say
I
she
said
to
me
and
I
don't
chew
sound
One
day
I
went
to
his
aunt's
house
because
the
boring
to
my
aunt's
house
behind
the
bamboo
inside
to
digging
up
bamboo
shoots
when
I
really
dig
vigorously
suddenly
heard
the
mother's
cry
I
came
down
to
see
his
aunt
said
Daddy
things
let
s
lose
face
so
my
mother
sometimes
hard
to
explain
for
oneself
sometimes
feel
helpless
because
she
feels
she
jumped
into
the
the
Yellow
River
wash
not
clear
so
she
felt
wronged
cry
In
fact
say
mother
instigated
is
possible
the
key
is
my
own
request
forcing
the
father
in
the
back
of
the
eternal
infamy
to
say
in
the
final
analysis
is
my
fault
so
I
ought
to
I
heard
my
mother
weeping
I
also
feel
very
sad
This
a
few
days
later
mother's
mood
has
not
been
good
if
not
more
I
see
my
mother
like
this
is
very
worried
After
a
few
days
of
school
another
week
has
passed
I
also
miss
dad
Don't
know
Dad
outside
doing
may
be
I
worry
most
X
x
on
the
evening
the
sun
nearly
down
hill
Dad
came
back
I
go
first
call
dad
like
my
father
and
several
years
not
to
meet
such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
say
uncle
s
contribution
but
not
all
because
I
have
three
hundred
yuan
to
make
books
uncle
didn't
go
with
me
in
the
said
dad
before
he
has
not
called
me
to
junior
high
school
but
a
three
again
three
advised
me
to
give
up
reading
now
papa
got
money
made
a
part
of
my
books
I
read
to
say
to
their
credit
is
a
little
exaggerated
Father
left
home
also
no
rest
was
mother
shouted
did
mother's
grievance
venting
gas
while
the
father
was
annoyed
do
not
know
to
whom
to
tell
he
ll

Mother
said

The
money

you
to
cheat
here
Oh
So
good
people
like

begging
Dad
shouted
who
said
that
To
who
said
that
You
give
me
a
call
My
accusers
Mother
said
without
confrontation
the
village
has
spread
to
open
You

the
village

make
inquiries

know
You're
so

to
them

Dad
said
Mother
said
your
sister-in-law
also
said
do
not
believe
you
can
go
and
ask
him
do
their
own
things
to
know
Later
my
father
also
do
not
know
to
have
to
confront
this
thing
Buleerle
But
the
father
and
mother
are
very
long
time
had
not
spoken
always
keep
silence
state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
very
so
stay
at
home
for
too
long
you
feel
so
lonely
and
boring
parents
also
I
have
no
job
but
feel
puzzled
think
it
over
and
over
again
had
no
friends
who
can
help
me
introduce
then
find
the
parents
remember
my
cousin
D

that
when
they
think
of

me
to

located
on

most

center
Although
the
city
as
it
is
my
most
beautiful
dream
also
is
I
most
look
forward
to
come
to
one
of
the
city
but
because

economically
not
rich
or
because
I
was
in
the
city
without
known
relatives
so
only
stayed
in
the
countryside
most
lifetime
until
since
junior
high
school
lost

I
forced
to
quit

but
in
the
country
for
half
a
year

the
honor
to
the
D

lead
I
first
came
to
the
city
to
work
Since
D

hear
my
boring
at
home
after
the
state
he
was
in
the
very
next
day
morning
speeding
and
returned
to
his
hometown
urged
me
to
go
to
the
city
to
do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or
promises
probably
at
that
time
I
have
been
in
the
dream
of
the
life
in
the
city
there's
nothing
to
refuse
the
And

while
sewing

of
a
hole
while
another

told
me
A
Cheng
You

never
been
to
the
city

must
listen
to
your
cousin's
arrangement
don't
go
out
on
a
night
out
that
will
make
your
brother
worry
will
let
us
worry
there
is
the
question
of
your
life
must
be
well
orderly
and
you
wear
and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother
and
friends
will
look
down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said
you
know
now
but
really
to
the
city
after
you
is
it
right
Our
words
as
unheeded
advice
that
an
inlet
and
an
outlet
to
forget
about
and
do
I
hope
you
not
if
you
so
dad
wouldn't
want
to
control
you
The
night
his
father
for
the
first
time
to
drink
is
also
the
first
time
that
I
drank
tincture
MOET
drunk
I
in
the
night
imperceptibly
in
wheezing
to
sleep
Early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
I
also
in
outdoor
breathe
fresh
air
waiting
for
mother
made
breakfast
eat
a
good
meal
with
my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also
can
Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or
accept
it
D's
said
rest
assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her
I
will
give
him
his
money
saved
in
the
home
My
father
put
the
money
back
pocket
looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
that
here
was
the
last
miss
that
my
heart
is
full
of
hope
full
of
ideals
is
my
nostalgia
reminds
me
of
the
beauty
of
my
hometown
As
tears
like
springs
that
my
surging
mood
as
in
heaven
so
here
swear
resolutely
obey
D's
command
I
went
to
Lake
source
direction
to
horse
sword
shift
car
went
straight
to
the
F
town
Go
forward
with
great
strength
and
vigour
to
the
F
city
F
City
we
in
the
long-distance
passenger
station
of
the
car
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
city
I
think
it's
great
it
is
because
I
first
saw
the
perfect
city
probably
for
the
city
people
the
city
is
not
big
because
there
are
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
such
as
Shanghai
Hangzhou
Nanjing
are
so
But
I
look
I
see
it
is
because
I
have
no
contact
with
the
city
and
the
first
contact
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
novelty
I
felt
that
here
is
my
dream
of
heaven
D
s
first
got
out
of
the
car
I
have
to
get
off
the
streets
together
with
him
I
don't
know
what
this
is
what
Lane
Road
always
feel
in
the
alley
as
in
gossip
so
I
feel
I
can't
touch
the
North
East
and
touched
the
East
has
touched
the
north
deeply
he
was
puzzled
When
I
came
to
a
river
river
sides
erected
a
high-rise
blocks
I
always
thought
that
this
is
the
Fuchun
River
I
really
think
you
saw
the
Fuchun
River
I
was
a
sigh
and
said
the
Fuchun
River
does
not
have
such
a
river
I
didn't
necessarily
it
big
D's
said
this
is
not
the
Fuchun
River
but
an
amaranth
Pujiang
I
said
oh
It
is
my
illusion
Words
I
am
his
behind
but
when
we
are
at
the
crossroads
in
the
middle
turn
right
this
is
a
long
hill
road
Liuzhou
Road
building
is
bristly
and
let
me
feel
the
perfect
city
economy
is
thriving
and
prosperous
each
poineering
hardships
may
make
it
difficult
to
imagine
as
I
came
to
a
world
came
to
a
childhood
paradise
I
see
a
paradise
of
dream
in
my
nose
to
dazzle
along
the
road
of
hill
of
dragon
of
the
past
it
is
a
city
surrounded
by
people
in
and
out
of
the
mall
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
in
the
commercial
city
upstairs
to
write
the
Fuchun
River
commercial
city
it
seems
like
I
know
this
is
F
the
city's
most
bustling
shopping
center
the
most
bustling
sidewalks
I
just
want
to
say
the
city
of
F
F
really
great
I
came
to
this
strange
city
I
really
feel
in
this
strange
city
I
can
absorb
your
sunny
temperament
to
be
a
city
that
the
giants
I
am
going
to
show
themselves
When
I
didn't
see
enough
outside
downtown
scene
I
was
D's
to
the
commercial
city
there
are
all
the
stalls
food
stands
above
the
green
vegetables
eggplant
garlic
onion
bean
curd
a
kind
sister
church
where
D's
stall
led
me
here
and
sister
chatted
a
while
when
the
elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
is
to
eat
lunch
saw
us
big
brother
put
down
his
chopsticks
call
us
to
sit
down
then
O
O
said
A
Cheng
Your
dinner
have
you
had
dinner
yet
I
haven't
answered
D's
for
I
said
we
have
no
Big
brother
says
here
to
eat
not
home
to
burn
She
also
said
yes
Or
here
to
eat
even
home
to
burn
much
trouble
D's
said
not
so
polite
home
to
burn
it
it
didn't
take
long
very
fast
He
made
the
remarks
at
the
same
time
I
still
look
around
because
I
see
here
is
such
a
big
stall
is
also
the
first
time
saw
so
many
dishes
people
buy
vegetable
stall
So
my
curiosity
in
here
is
not
fun
When
I
put
the
spirit
are
concentrated
in
the
food
stalls
of
things
he
finished
on
the
go
I'm
still
hazy
a
bit
at
a
loss
situation
he
said
to
me
A
Cheng
we
go
I
didn't
hear
there
is
one
point
be
absent-minded
look
he
coaxed
out
of
said
hello
What's
on
your
mind
Told
you
so
loudly
did
not
hear
Go
I
said
oh
Elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
to
pick
some
fresh
vegetables
let
you
bring
us
back
to
cook
he
and
I
left
sister
they
couple
booth
then
to
another
butcher
shop
stall
bought
several
kilograms
of
meat
left
the
commercial
city
and
imperceptibly
and
through
a
Malaysian
Road
came
to
a
named
Zhou
Jianong
lane
across
the
alley
alley
went
to
D's
house
D's
house
is
an
underground
garage
inside
a
very
the
smell
is
also
important
I
very
want
to
move
out
but
I
will
not
economic
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
environment
here
it
is
the
parents
of
thousand
exhort
enjoin
let
I
firmly
remember
them
you
want
me
to
listen
to
D's
so
I
had
to
reluctantly
stay
When
I
walked
inside
the
heat
from
the
outside
directly
to
heaven
so
I
really
feel
it's
hard
I
am
afraid
went
into
the
furnace
of
the
house
let
me
really
angry
be
ashamed
of
dying
When
I
was
in
the
hot
sun
dried
by
the
sun
at
the
same
time
D's
said
why
don't
you
come
in
Quickly
Wash
dishes
I
went
to
go
say
to
him
it
is
too
hot
I
have
a
bit
of
a
bear
D's
continued
hot
A
fan
Do
not
be
afraid
of
heat
a
long
time
to
get
over
I
come
too
but
we
insist
on
the
stand
A
man
should
be
afraid
of
tired
we
are
so
out
of
practice
I
said
oh
Came
to
give
him
food
finished
lunch
he's
out
let
me
have
a
rest
at
home
for
a
day
starting
tomorrow
I
promised
D's
a
boring
also
have
a
look
at
the
room
television
occasionally
to
bring
home
the
story
books
doubled
the
old
warm
up
in
primary
and
secondary
schools
the
residual
reading
difficulty
One
day
in
the
imperceptibly
in
the
past
soon
arrived
at
dusk
D's
also
returned
to
cook
I
don't
know
how
to
cook
so
there
are
a
lot
of
housework
is
D's
one
person
to
complete
I
can
only
one
wash
dishes
clean
the
room
health
or
what
other
are
not
good
At
night
after
dinner
D's
and
I
had
to
watch
TV
in
bed
TV
also
is
no
good
program
I
watched
a
imperceptibly
fell
asleep
Suddenly
I
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
I
will
readily
but
here
I
can
not
find
the
toilet
was
anxious
to
panic
I
find
that
I
finally
find
convenient
corner
when
I
finished
returned
was
a
patrol
car
through
here
I
was
found
by
police
as
a
thief
was
caught
The
car
out
of
the
two
patrol
to
check
my
ID
card
I
came
to
the
interior
from
my
bag
show
identity
cards
to
give
them
they
took
out
the
register
put
my
name
and
identity
card
number
is
recorded
in
it
and
again
and
again
I
ask
my
family
and
address
then
they
contact
D
s
asked
his
identity
asked
his
work
address
information
is
very
detailed
and
they
have
put
D
s
identity
as
a
pledge
export
to
a
television
set
let
him
leave
the
TV
invoice
and
specifications
to
verify
can
put
his
things
he
returned
to
the
He
had
to
accept
to
let
them
D's
until
the
patrol
had
gone
he
said
how
can
you
not
carefully
let
the
guard
discovered
I
said
I
don't
know
How
do
I
know
the
night
police
so
fiercely
knew
that
I
wouldn't
back
out
D's
continued
next
to
a
sharp
point
don't
be
so
idiotic
Know
or
not
Said
oh
Know
Put
out
the
light
then
we
sleep
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
sleep
at
night
because
the
room
was
at
night
is
also
very
difficult
to
eliminate
unless
the
outside
temperature
drops
to
the
upper
20s
degrees
after
midnight
there
may
be
more
comfortable
Wake
up
the
first
thing
I
do
is
to
wash
brush
work
then
I
put
a
few
of
the
ash
bucket
and
a
large
shovels
and
in
D
s
back
leading
me
to
play
first
In
fact
I
don't
know
what
is
hard
what
is
helpless
life
I
have
not
try
at
home
parents
regard
me
as
a
saint
as
for
at
that
time
I
feel
so
blessed
and
now
I
can
only
obey
D's
leadership
as
his
apprentice
I
came
to
the
city
gates
then
turn
to
the
Old
Road
South
Gate
Street
South
Gate
Street
rely
on
the
Fuchun
River
and
that
a
large
river
it
is
the
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
we
stand
position
is
the
Fuchun
River
ferry
terminal
just
because
it
is
against
the
direction
of
the
city
to
the
South
so
it
means
draw
road
also
known
as
South
Gate
Street
near
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
I
came
here
did
not
look
at
the
moon
not
here
on
vacation
trip
or
something
I
was
just
a
young
worker
come
to
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
many-storied
buildings
work
most
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
river
I
and
it
are
not
fate
I
climbed
to
the
six
floor
of
this
building
opened
the
door
there
are
several
woodworking
early
start
working
here
their
decoration
process
of
half
I
come
here
only
a
toilet
and
a
wing
not
paved
tiles
This
is
D
s
and
I
started
to
do
it
My
first
day
at
work
is
to
carry
cement
bag
or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too
much
I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
is
D
s
wake
me
from
this
dream
urged
me
to
go
to
work
I
mistily
mistily
to
get
up
go
to
work
work
on
the
path
of
two
feet
in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a
little
be
petrified
like
How
can
I
not
to
mention
the
spirit
Seems
to
me
the
wholeEven
if
more
magnificent
rhetoric
Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk
the
voice
Beat
the
floor
Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me
babble
learn
language
I
learned
to
language
in
the
river
The
first
word-mom
How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only
for
repel
mosquitoes
Breeze
send
me
to
sleep
But
regardless
of
the
eyebrows
climb
sweat
poured
Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite
write
of
word
Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
and
vertical
dignified
and
imposing
You
said
that
a
man
have
to
like
it
Young
i
was
not
sensible
Occasionally
make
a
mistake
You
taught
me
the
force
of
justice
I
keep
in
mind
your
word
Dare
not
have
a
bit
slight
In
order
to
build
a
quiet
environment
for
my
studies
The
already
heavy
burden
of
the
family
You
take
on
all
the
housework
and
farm
work
Even
if
was
too
tired
to
take
a
breath
Also
won't
let
me
take
part
in
I
was
moved
to
nothing
to
say
In
my
memory
You've
never
luxury
one
coin
You
let
me
know
what
is
bitter
What
is
sweet
In
your
reference
I
have
learned
to
pinch
and
scrape
On
the
way

Several
times

want
to
surrender

of
incentive
of
look
in
the
eyes

Let
me

pace
of
progress
Youth
at
a
loss
You
listen
to
me
dribs
and
drabs
And
give
me
all
of
the
analysis
and
directions
I
like
the
blind
man
to
regain
the
light
when
injustice
and
resentment
All
the
world
don't
understand
me
Only
you
know
me
In
you
here
I
got
the
light
when
faced
with
the
choices
I
hesitate
to
stray
around
You
give
me

But
you
won¡¯t

Once
again
cry
out
Mom
I
love

Wish
you
have
a
good
health
And
happy
every
dayHas
been
that
a
man
hiding
in
the
side
to
steal
cry
age
has
been
the
world
runs
age
has
not
remember
from
when
to
begin
planning
for
the
future
imagine
the
life
don't
remember
from
what
time
to
worry
more
and
more
I
started
back
to
have
a
look
their
growth
path
one
every
day
watching
I
alone
posture
standing
on
the
roadside
inserted
his
hands
in
pants
I
see
countless
people
from
my
side
deadpan
passed
by
they
came
on
with
the
coffee
holding
a
drink
take
the
textbook
with
mobile
phone
They
be
in
a
hurry
to
depart
put
me
off
like
an
idle
about
Occasionally
someone
stopped
smiled
at
me
I
know
these
people
stay
down
is
the
warmth
of
my
life
they
will
never
abandon
I
care
be
the
source
of
my
life
Guo
Jingming
said
my
friends
are
my
courage
to
live
and
they
give
me
your
ability
let
me
face
this
world
no
longer
panic
Those
who
have
and
be
crazy
with
me
with
sadness
with
cycling
through
the
thin
youth
friend
I
think
we
all
remember
the
youth
is
how
we
face
cannot
erase
the
traces
Xiao
chen
went
to
Hainan
in
a
dessert
shop
as
dessert
Whenever
we
have
a
vacation
will
be
received
her
phone
call
she
received
the
text
message
she
always
likes
to
write
very
long
As
it
was
she
knew
I
was
a
very
insecure
afraid
to
lose
even
if
there
is
no
important
will
also
write
a
long
message
let
me
know
her
by
my
side
never
leave
Chen
is
a
very
clever
girl
but
in
the
study
does
not
enlighten
after
each
test
there
will
always
be
that
her
poor
grades
in
my
front
side
into
my
mouth
ice
cream
a
begged
me
to
help
her
with
We
have
been
together
for
9
years
so
only
a
piece
of
memory
I
always
thought
she
was
a
bright
child
happy
and
simple
life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
From
the
bright
sunlight
If
the
rain
from
the
cloud
Break
your
pride
Think
of
my
love
for
you
And
everything
shall
be
fine
Let
us
soar
let
us
fly
To
the
highest
height
And
everything
shall
be
fineLast
year
the
cancer
nearly
finished
me
off
However
with
the
accompaniment
of
my
best
friend
Candice
I
could
eventually
get
through
these
tough
time
Sometimes
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
always
stand
by
my
side
Last
summer
the
doctor
discovered
that
I
suffered
from
lung
cancer
At
that
moment
I
was
completely
shocked
All
memories
that
I
have
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
in
seconds
I
thought
I
was
going
to
leave
all
my
friends
my
family
and
all
people
I
loved
To
me
the
whole
world
was
just
sinking
Luckily
that
was
just
in
an
early
stage
and
the
doctor
said
that
I
had
I
great
chance
to
recover
after
a
series
of
treatments
But
he
warned
me
that
the
treatment
would
be
very
tough
and
painful
At
first
I
have
considered
to
refuse
the
treatment
However
after
I
have
though
about
all
of
my
valuable
friends
and
my
mom
and
dad
I
chose
to
take
the
chance
During
the
treatment
I
gradually
suffered
from
the
side
effects
The
number
of
hairs
on
my
head
declined
and
I
vomited
from
dawn
till
night
on
every
single
day
I
had
a
very
poor
appetite
and
I
nearly
had
no
desired
to
put
any
food
to
my
mouth
I
was
very
painful
and
I
was
thinking
about
giving
up
the
treatment
I
though
I
could
not
tolerate
it
anymore
However
with
the
support
and
encouragement
from
my
best
friend
Candice
I
have
eventually
made
it
through
the
rain
and
stand
up
once
again
Finally
I
recovered
One
summer
night
Candice
came
to
the
hospital
to
visit
me
We
sat
on
the
bench
that
facing
the
sea
The
sun
was
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
night
descended
We
chatted
underneath
the
stars
We
have
not
met
each
other
since
the
graduation
Candice
said
with
tears
on
her
face
Yes
I
have
never
thought
we
would
have
the
reunion
in
the
situation
I
said
She
kept
silent
with
her
tears
in
the
warm
gentle
breeze
We
have
been
best
friends
since
we
were
small
I
do
not
want
this
friendship
to
end
up
so
soon
She
cried
desperately
Zach
you
are
a
man
You
are
a
man
who
is
courageous
and
adventurous
You
should
have
that
guts
to
fight
for
your
life
and
people
around
you
But
Now
I
am
going
to
give
you
the
courage
you
need
She
lay
her
hand
on
me
Lord
please
give
this
little
boy
love
and
hope
to
face
the
obstacle
that
he
is
now
facing
Please
give
him
courage
to
help
him
to
find
the
way
Now
you
have
already
possessed
the
ability
to
fight
this
war
You
should
never
give
up
as
there
is
a
light
in
your
heart
and
shines
very
brightly
Since
them
I
understand
that
when
fate
is
tough
just
toughen
your
faith
With
a
smile
I
know
I
could
face
the
future
no
matter
what
lay
ahead
And
there's
a
hero
comes
along
with
the
strength
to
carry
on
My
dad
has
always
used
this
song
to
encourage
me
Until
he
passed
away
I
still
keep
this
song
in
my
iPod
and
listen
to
it
when
I
need
to
get
through
some
tough
time
To
me
this
song
does
not
only
symbolize
the
spirit
of
my
dad
but
also
mine
This
song
is
ubiquitous
in
various
singing
competitions
Regardless
of
its
singing
technique
the
beautiful
melody
and
those
meaningful
lyrics
has
helped
many
people
to
get
through
obstacles
This
fabulous
song
was
composed
by
American
singer-songwriter
Mariah
Carey
in
1993
and
definitely
performed
by
herself
The
song
mentioned
that
among
every
single
one
of
us
a
hero
lies
inside
our
heart
If
we
try
to
reach
into
our
soul
our
emptiness
will
disappear
There's
a
hero
if
you
look
inside
your
heart
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid
of
who
you
are
When
I
was
small
I
was
a
child
who
was
so
fragile
and
cried
easily
I
was
afraid
of
everything
I
was
so
this
and
small
and
when
my
classmates
bullied
me
all
I
would
do
was
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
and
cry
from
dawn
till
night
Worse
still
I
was
poor
in
academic
result
and
no
teachers
loved
me
On
these
days
I
found
myself
useless
and
believed
that
no
one
in
this
world
would
recognise
this
small
potato
I
was
so
desperate
Yet
in
one
dark
night
my
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
hand
was
so
large
and
warm
All
I
could
feel
was
the
love
and
hope
transmitted
through
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
and
to
my
heart
and
soul
Son
you
should
not
be
fragile
anymore
But
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
Now
I
am
going
to
recall
your
hero
from
your
soul
and
from
now
on
you
would
never
feel
lonely
anymore
My
hero
and
your
hero
have
already
stayed
together
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
Other
people
can
say
anything
they
want
to
say
Although
they
try
to
bring
you
down
you
will
never
allow
them
to
do
so
because
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
This
hero
will
always
stay
close
to
you
and
protect
you
forever
Afterwards
he
sang
this
song
to
me
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow
But
don't
let
anyone
to
tear
them
away
Since
then
whenever
I
need
to
face
any
problems
or
obstacles
alone
I
will
not
be
fragile
anymore
All
I
need
to
do
is
sing
Hero
along
with
my
hero
and
my
father's
hero
and
I
will
certainly
know
that
my
father
will
guide
me
where
I
should
go
I
know
that
there
is
a
light
in
me
and
shines
very
brightly
and
other
people
can
try
but
they
can
never
take
that
away
from
me
The
meeting
is
WangHai
Time
always
unknowingly
hurried
away
flash
Also
in
the
online
to
spend
a
few
years
Cry
also
laughed
Thousands
of
day
and
night
WangHai
roaming
A
thought
to
mature
Walk
to
the
friend
go
to
How
many
friends
already
not
disappear
Sitting
alone
in
the
space
is
cold
and
cheerless
Some
vague
sad
loss
Thankfully
Have
a
lot
of
friends
have
been
silent
about
Accompany
me
along
the
way
Always
buchibuqi
In
the
virtual

Deduce
true
feelings
Behind
the
screen
in

cold
And
each
wish
Whenever
the
birthday
Will
receive
blessings
of
friends
Very
often
I

unceasingly
Thanks

and

Because
of
you
Lonely

not
lonely
Because
of
you
My
birthday
is
not
cold
and
cheerless
Of
a
friend
said
I
am
not
alone
My

Thousands
of

a
moment
of

Don't

Both

and
I

may
not
agree
to
our

she
is
still
your
mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left
Thomas
Carlyle
lived
from
1795
until
1881
He
was
a
10000
wow
gold
Scot
essayist
and
historian
During
his
lifetime
he
became
one
of
the
world's
greatest
writers
But
he
was
a
human
and

On

1826

Carlyle
married
his
secretary
Jane
Welsh
She
was
an
intelligent
attractive
and
somewhat
temperamental
daughter
of
a
well-to-do
doctor
They
had
their
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
but
still
loved
Bathroom
Vanities
each
other
dearly
After
their
marriage
Jane
continued
to
serve
as
his
secretary
But
after
several
years
of
marriage
Jane
became
ill
Being
Bathroom
Mirrors
a
hard
worker
Carlyle
became
so
absorbed
in
his
writings
that
he
let
Jane
continue
working
for
several
weeks
after
she
became
ill
She
had
cancer
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
slow
growing
kind
she
finally
became
confined
to
her
bed
Although
Carlyle
loved
her
Bathroom
Accessories
dearly
he
very
seldom
found
time
to
stay
with
her
long
He
was
busy
with
his
work
when
Jane
died
they
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
for
the
service
The
day
Glass
Basin
was
a
miserable
day
It
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
Following
the
funeral
Carlyle
went
back
to
his
home
He
was
taking
it
pretty
hard
He
went
up
the
stairs
to
Jane's
room
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
her
bed
He
sat
there
thinking
Shower
Enclosures
about
how
little
time
he
had
spent
with
her
and
wishing
so
much
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
differently
Noticing
her
diary
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
picked
it
up
and
began
to
steel
shelving
read
it
Suddenly
he
seemed
shocked
He
saw
it
There
on
one
page
she
had
written
Interior
Doors
a
single
line
Yesterday
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
and
it
was
like
heaven
I
love
him
so
Something
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
He
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
that
he
meant
so
much
to
her
He
thought
of
all
wow
gold
australia
the
times
he
had
gone
about
his
work
without
thinking
about
and
noticing
her
Then
Carlyle
turned
the
page
in
the
diary
There
he
noticed
she
racking
had
written
some
words
that
broke
his
heart
I
have
listened
all
day
to
hear
his
steps
in
the
hall
but
now
it
is
late
and
I
guess
he
won't
come
today
Carlyle
read
a
little
more
in
the
book
Then
he
threw
it
down
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Some
of
his
friends
found
him
at
the
grave
his
buy
wow
gold
australia
face
buried
in
the
mud
His
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
Tears
continued
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
He
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
If
I
had
only
known
if
I
had
only
known
But
it
was
too
late
for
Carlyle
She
was
dead
After
Jane's
death
Carlyle
made
world
of
warcraft
gold
for
sale
little
attempt
to
write
again
The
historians
say
he
lived
another
15
years
weary
bored
and
a
partial
recluse
I
share
the
story
with
in
the
hope
that
you
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
While
our
loved
ones
must
have
the
money
we
make
to
live
it
is
the
love
we
have
that
they
really
want
Give
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
It
is
not
easy
to
define
what
kind
of
meaning
to
the
enterprise
culture
because
the
enterpise
culture
stems
from
the
ration
and
reality
which
should
be
related
to
the
regulations
or
how
to
react
to
the
risk
of
management
or
market
instead
of
just
focusing
on
training
and
meeting
which
should
be
related
to
the
proportion
of
thoughts
of
belonging
to
our
company
and
benefitting
our
company
in
the
difficulty
Sometimes
the
puzzled
people
are
always
in
the
mess
of
understanding
of
why
the
itemized
regulations
could
not
optimize
the
operation
and
not
regulate
the
action
of
some
officials
who
always
abused
the
power
to
benefit
themselves
which
lead
to
the
argument
that
as
long
as
the
company
is
so
large
that
the
culture
of
enterprise
is
absolutly
difficult
to
be
built
up
Different
people
with
different
education
background
and
different
comprehension
of
society
would
not
be
integrated
to
the
common
recognition
of
enterprise
culture
which
is
the
crux
to
help
the
company
be
prosperous
In
spite
of
training
many
officials
there
are
lots
of
bottlenecks
which
should
be
smoothed
and
holes
which
should
be
covered
so
we
must
work
out
some
measures
to
make
our
company
step
on
the
right
road
Regulations
are
parts
of
the
enterprise
culture
making
the
road
straight
but
what
kind
of
regulations
are
suitful
to
the
state-owned
company
The
regulation
are
always
eroded
by
dereliction
and
are
not
always
strickly
implemented
by
some
departments
Frankly
speaking
the
enterprise
culture
is
just
having
some
aspects
in
consciousness
frequently
dominating
the
behavior
which
would
give
us
some
reference
on
how
to
enact
the
detailed
regulations
could
get
the
return
as
expected
The
most
important
thing
related
to
the
enterprise
culture
is
how
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
in
the
every
respect
of
operation
We
must
detail
every
process
of
how
to
control
the
cost
and
how
to
make
the
work
efficient
and
rational
If
employee
could
make
their
regulations
rooted
in
mind
they
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
keep
them
from
dereliction
and
would
try
their
best
to
devote
the
wisdom
to
benifitting
our
company.For
example
The
flaws
in
human
nature
and
the
shortage
of
wealth
would
seduce
the
officals
to
accept
the
secret
money
from
agencies
who
are
intended
to
pull
down
the
officals
by
all
kinds
of
tactics
and
if
the
officals
are
too
fragile
to
resist
the
gifts
they
would
be
united
with
agencies
to
cheat
our
company
so
the
task
which
brooks
no
delay
is
the
education
brainwashing
and
making
the
severe
punishment
happen
without
them
the
enterprise
culture
is
like
the
moon
in
water
like
the
flowers
in
mist
like
the
stupid
being
called
clever
What
is
the
quintessence
of
the
enterprise
culture
It
is
easy
or
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
conclusion
because
it
is
a
hard
job
to
change
people¡¯s
mindset
which
is
always
in
the
prejustice.So
at
first
we
must
scrutinize
the
origin
of
the
prejustice
why
are
so
many
people
always
just
negating
others
because
we
are
extremely
lack
of
communication
to
understand
with
each
other
lacking
of
wisdom
to
tell
the
right
and
the
wrong
lacking
of
the
wide
chest
to
tolerate
the
different
ideas
wnich
lead
to
misunderstand
among
people
and
to
form
the
impasse
to
flexibly
resolve
the
thorny
problem.There
are
some
words
similar
and
implicated
with
the
word
culture
in
dictionary
such
as
communication
concoct
cooperation
coordination
copartner
control¡±
giving
us
some
metaphor
or
euphemism
that
enterprise
culture
must
depend
on
the
communication
cooperation
must
control
the
ridiculous
behavior
of
some
officials
must
concoct
the
atmosphere
from
stiff
suffocated
environment
to
the
active
creative
philosophical
philanthropic
state
of
mindset
of
everyone.But
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
behavior
spontaneously
follow
the
bright
side
of
human
being
just
because
of
the
fragile
and
selfish
nature
of
people
with
some
ignorant
knowledge
about
themselves
so
using
the
regulations
to
control
the
devil
in
their
mindset
and
encouraging
the
bold
attitude
to
resolve
the
present
and
history
problem
is
the
essential
way
of
making
the
enterprise
culture
alive
and
giving
the
light
to
the
employee
We
must
change
the
thoughts
that
we
are
isolated
by
others
we
are
just
living
for
ourself
we
are
just
focusing
on
our
private
cases
to
the
thoughts
that
if
we
can
help
each
other
if
we
believe
in
the
philosophy
of
strengthenning
the
consciousness
of
doing
the
job
positively
and
wisely
getting
good
return
we
can
achieve
the
goal
of
making
our
company
profitful
and
competitive
even
making
our
life
happy
Why
are
the
employee
always
having
no
enthusiasm
and
lacking
of
a
little
responsibility
in
their
job?why
are
there
lots
of
complaint
in
our
company?why
are
the
talented
people
resigning
quickly
from
our
company?Yes
the
salary
is
the
key
and
having
no
feeling
in
cooperation
unity
belonging
and
having
not
the
promising
future
are
the
fundamental
reasons
which
steamrollerred
the
spirit
to
be
loyal
to
company
so
putting
the
importance
of
employee
in
priority
is
the
way
of
having
the
high
competition
in
this
globallized
world
A
healthy
company
is
the
one
that
urgently
need
the
creative
advices
from
employee
in
stead
of
closing
their
eyes
filling
in
their
ears
in
front
of
the
employee
who
may
have
some
profound
and
pragmatic
ideas
which
maybe
benifit
to
the
operation
of
our
company.But
how
to
distinguish
the
good
ideas
or
the
wrong
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
leaders
who
must
look
through
everything
including
themselves
and
others
adding
that
they
must
comprehend
the
logic
of
mindset
and
behavior
of
themself
To
be
leaders
the
open
attitude
is
the
good
way
to
rationalize
the
management
adopting
the
positive
way
to
eliminate
the
flaws
in
the
structure
and
to
attain
the
goal
with
attacking
the
black
hands¡±
instead
of
always
being
in
defensive
measure
of
healing
the
fissure
in
management
that
is
deficient
in
courage
and
wisdom.It
is
also
one
part
of
the
enterprise
culture.Frankly
saying
having
good
return
to
our
company
is
dominated
by
the
fate
by
the
hearts
of
all
employee
by
the
regulations
by
the
rational
philosophy
by
the
authentic
wisdom
Service
is
the
culture
it
sounds
like
simple
but
complicated
and
profound
if
you
want
to
make
it
better
and
better
How
to
do
service
is
the
important
culture
of
enterprise
which
could
attract
many
people
to
take
our
flights
again
and
again.We
can
ask
a
simple
question
that
if
you
look
up
to
see
the
twinkled
stars
in
night
what
make
you
comfortable?The
answer
is
easy
the
bright
the
color
make
you
feel
comfortable
which
can
make
us
have
some
comprehension
that
if
you
make
people¡¯s
body
such
as
eye
ear
limbs
nose
heart
feel
nice
your
service
is
the
nice
service
if
you
make
the
customers
angry
you
failed
in
doing
service.So
you
must
think
over
how
to
make
the
customers
feel
better
is
the
best
way
to
learn
how
to
give
service
to
these
arrogant
and
hypercritical
customers
Above
all
We
can
understand
that
if
you
have
regulations
in
your
mindset
which
sometimes
is
selfish
and
Out
of
my
window
the
darkness
gave
me
a
signal:if
you
are
habitted
in
the
darkness
of
heart
you
would
be
dissappionted
for
ever.sometimes
I
want
to
find
the
way
of
making
me
in
the
positive
attitude
to
the
life
but
always
are
beated
by
my
experiences
which
cutted
off
the
robe
attached
to
the
sunshine.but
the
frustrated
happenning
is
not
the
domination
which
converts
my
good
intention
to
the
devil
the
domination
is
my
thoughts
which
are
sometimes
not
superficial
but
profound
gives
me
the
light
and
warm
to
live
simply
and
happily
What
kind
of
thoughts
would
release
my
pressure
and
gives
me
the
ability
to
survive
in
the
chilly
and
choppy
reality
which
would
distort
the
heart
fragile
to
the
fragmentary
condition
or
make
the
heart
wisom
strong
get
the
meaning
of
life
which
would
push
me
to
the
heaven
with
lots
of
beauty
and
full
I
would
say
that
my
thoughts
is
related
to
the
thoughts
themselves
if
you
can
change
the
thoughts
quickly
and
correctedly
you
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
pusure
the
objects
you
want;if
you
are
stubborn
enough
you
would
be
easily
defeated
by
the
fate
which
urgently
need
the
wisdom
light
to
cover
the
black
in
the
mindset
full
of
good
and
evil
When
I
was
a
child
I
do
not
know
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
and
have
no
faith
which
would
comfort
my
soul
to
give
me
a
light
would
direct
my
road
to
the
tranquillized
home
My
pressure
is
from
my
family
where
my
father
is
not
a
reasonable
person
and
had
no
ideas
on
how
to
cultivate
my
individual
personality
and
my
character
so
in
the
long
time
I
felt
the
life
of
mine
is
in
hell
even
if
I
have
food
to
eat
have
cloth
to
wear
but
my
heart
was
in
deep
frustration
and
had
much
hatre
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
shaping
my
thoughts
that
the
life
had
not
power
to
lift
me
from
the
miserable
conditions.after
long
long
time
the
climate
has
been
changed
to
more
warm
the
rivers
have
been
changed
to
more
polluted
the
hearts
of
many
people
have
been
changed
by
desire
for
money
to
be
vicious
my
god
has
given
me
the
enlight
that
if
you
can
comprehend
the
love
the
truth
you
can
have
sheft
below
the
sunshine
which
would
fill
you
and
warm
you
so
it
is
my
fortunation
I
can
get
the
hints
from
god
giving
me
the
truth
which
fattened
my
twisted
raods
in
the
mist
and
I
can
smile
happily
and
never
be
frustrated
again
Even
if
I
explain
the
understanding
of
love
and
truth
again
and
again
lots
of
people
still
had
lof
of
question
on
my
comprehension
about
the
thoughts
as
same
as
my
past.in
my
past
I
was
puzzled
intensifiedly
on
some
meaningful
words.some
people
said
to
me
the
words
wisdom
but
it
is
like
a
fool
who
can
not
distinguish
what
is
right
or
wrong
I
am
delayed
to
understand
the
truth
which
stumbled
my
existence
and
made
me
fall
to
hell.but
the
darkness
is
not
always
having
no
light
maybe
my
god
has
pity
on
me
one
day
I
found
thoughts
can
change
my
action
my
attitude
to
the
life
I
confronted
that
is
in
the
embarrassed
condition.after
I
have
been
changed
to
the
peace
life
by
the
fresh
way
of
thinking
I
can
in
confidence
make
a
conclusion
that
please
believing
in
the
god¡¯s
soul
that
tell
you
what
is
yours
what
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
this
world
worthy
pusuring
you
should
love
should
dent
the
suffering
you
have
got
and
smiling
in
the
darkness
stubborn
and
everyone
would
follow
the
regulations
rooted
in
your
heart
thinking
of
the
company
as
your
own
our
enterprise
would
be
promising.The
safety
and
service
is
the
crux
to
our
enterprise
we
must
strengthen
our
consciousness
to
keep
them
in
our
mind
and
do
our
best
to
support
it
VIRTUE
is
like
a
rich
stone
best
plain
set
and
surely
virtue
is
best
in
a
body
that
is
comely
though
not
of
delicate
features
and
that
hath
rather
dignity
of
presence
than
beauty
of
aspect
Neither
is
it
almost
seen
that
very
beautiful
persons
are
otherwise
of
great
virtue
as
if
nature
were
rather
busy
not
to
err
than
in
labor
to
produce
excellency
And
therefore
they
prove
accomplished
but
not
of
great
spirit
and
study
rather
behavior
than
virtue
But
this
holds
not
always
for
Augustus
Caesar
Titus
Vespasianus
Philip
le
Belle
of
France
Edward
the
Fourth
of
England
Alcibiades
of
Athens
Ismael
the
Sophy
of
Persia
were
all
high
and
great
spirits
and
yet
the
most
beautiful
men
of
their
times
In
beauty
that
of
favor
is
more
than
that
of
color
and
that
of
decent
and
gracious
motion
more
than
that
of
favor
That
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
cannot
express
no
nor
the
first
sight
of
the
life
There
is
no
excellent
beauty
that
hath
not
some
strangeness
in
the
proportion
A
man
cannot
tell
whether
Apelles
or
Albert
Durer
were
the
more
trifler
whereof
the
one
would
make
a
personage
by
geometrical
proportions
the
other
by
taking
the
best
parts
out
of
divers
faces
to
make
one
excellent
Such
personages
I
think
would
please
nobody
but
the
painter
that
made
them
Not
but
I
think
a
painter
may
make
a
better
face
than
ever
was
but
he
must
do
it
by
a
kind
of
felicity
as
a
musician
that
maketh
an
excellent
air
in
music
and
not
by
rule
A
man
shall
see
faces
that
if
you
examine
them
part
by
part
you
shall
find
never
a
good
and
yet
altogether
do
well
If
it
be
true
that
the
principal
part
of
beauty
is
in
decent
motion
certainly
it
is
no
marvel
though
persons
in
years
seem
many
times
more
amiable
pulchrorum
autumnus
pulcher
for
no
youth
can
be
comely
but
by
pardon
and
considering
the
youth
as
to
make
up
the
comeliness
Beauty
is
as
summer
fruits
which
are
easy
to
corrupt
and
cannot
last
and
for
the
most
part
it
makes
a
dissolute
youth
and
an
age
a
little
out
of
countenance
but
yet
certainly
again
if
it
light
well
it
maketh
virtue
shine
and
vices
blush
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
It
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
again
until
it
was
firm
enough
As
time
passed
there
were
other
rules
to
learn
Always
do
your
best.""Do
it
now.""Never
lie
And
most
importantly
"You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
By
my
teens
he
wasn't
telling
me
what
to
do
anymore
which
was
scary
and
heady
at
the
same
time
He
provided
perspective
not
telling
me
what
was
around
the
great
corner
of
life
but
letting
me
know
there
was
a
lot
more
than
just
today
and
the
next
which
I
hadn't
thought
of
One
day
I
realize
now
there
was
a
change
I
wasn't
trying
to
please
him
so
much
as
I
was
trying
to
impress
him
I
never
asked
him
to
come
to
my
football
games
He
had
a
high-pressure
career
and
it
meant
driving
through
most
of
Friday
night
But
for
all
the
big
games
when
I
looked
over
at
the
sideline
there
was
that
familiar
fedora
And
by
God
did
the
opposing
team
captain
ever
get
a
firm
handshake
and
a
gaze
he
would
remember
Then
a
school
fact
contradicted
something
he
said
Impossible
that
he
could
be
wrong
but
there
it
was
in
the
book
These
accumulated
over
time
along
with
personal
experiences
to
buttress
my
own
developing
sense
of
values
And
I
could
tell
we
had
each
taken
our
own
perfectly
normal
paths
I
began
to
see
too
his
blind
spots
his
prejudices
and
his
weaknesses
I
never
threw
these
up
at
him
He
hadn't
to
me
and
anyway
he
seemed
to
need
protection
I
stopped
asking
his
advice
the
experiences
he
drew
from
no
longer
seemed
relevant
to
the
decisions
I
had
to
make
He
volunteered
advice
for
a
while
But
then
in
more
recent
years
politics
and
issues
gave
way
to
talk
of
empty
errands
and
always
to
ailments
From
his
bed
he
showed
me
the
many
sores
and
scars
on
his
misshapen
body
and
all
the
bottles
for
medicine
Sometimes
he
confided
I
would
just
like
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
not
wake
up
After
much
thought
and
practice
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
one
night
last
winter
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
and
remembered
for
an
instant
those
terrifying
dark
holes
in
another
house
35
years
before
I
told
my
fatherhow
much
I
loved
him
I
described
all
the
things
people
were
doing
for
him
But
I
said
he
kept
eating
poorly
hiding
in
his
room
and
violating
the
doctor's
orders
No
amount
of
love
could
make
someone
else
care
about
life
I
said
it
was
a
two-way
street
He
wasn't
doing
his
best
The
decision
was
his
He
said
he
knew
how
hard
my
words
had
been
to
say
and
how
proud
he
was
of
me
I
had
the
best
teacher
I
said
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
He
smiled
a
little
And
we
shook
hands
firmly
for
the
last
time
Several
days
later
at
about
4
A.M
my
mother
heard
Dad
shuffling
about
their
dark
room
I
have
some
things
I
have
to
do
he
said
He
paid
a
bundle
of
bills
He
composed
for
my
mother
a
long
list
of
legal
and
financial
what-to-do's
in
case
of
emergency
And
he
wrote
me
a
note
Then
he
walked
back
to
his
bed
and
laid
himself
down
He
went
to
sleep
naturally
And
he
did
not
wake
up
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial
Party
committees
have
created
detailed
policies
to
improve
their
working
style
as
required
by
the
country's
core
leadership
With
these
measures
Party
authorities
are
attempting
to
get
closer
to
the
public
experts
said
We
have
seen
lots
of
fresh
working
styles
from
the
newly
elected
Party
leaders
such
as
fewer
cliches
at
conferences
no
traffic
controls
during
inspection
tours
and
so

said
Zhu
Lijia
a
professor
of
public
administration
research
at
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Governance
But
Party
authorities
should
enhance
supervision
and
those
who
violate
regulations
should
be
punished

added
In
a
10-item
regulation

According
to
the

the
eight
measures
officials

and
main
Party

Beijing
municipal
Party
committee
said
on
Dec
19
in
a
document

And
also
I

him
in

Michelle
Obama
who
said
their
grueling
campaign
schedules
made
them
two

And
the

him
was
when
I

continued
And
that¡¯s
my
honey
giving
me
a
hug
I

MOSCOW
Dec
26
Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans
on
U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against
Russians
abroad
and
persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take
effect
on
Jan
1
2013
if
signed
by
the
president
into
law
Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov
told
local
media
Wednesday
that
Putin
would
consider
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
within
two
weeks
after
the
Federation
Council
approved
it
The
State
Duma
or
lower
house
of
the
parliament
on
Friday
passed
the
bill
with
420
parliamentarians
voting
yes
seven
voting
against
and
one
abstaining
However
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
was
not
supported
by
all
the
Russians
On
Wednesday
the
Moscow
police
have
detained
four
people
near
the
Federation
Council
building
who
were
protesting
against
the
bill
Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
in
November
1989
All
member
states
are
obliged
to
develop
and
undertake
all
actions
and
policies
in
the
light
of
the
best
interests
of
a
child
Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
Users
shall
be
responsible
for
reclaiming
the
same
area
and
quality
of
cultivated
land
they
use
for
construction
of
non-agricultural
projects
the
Land
Administration
Law
stipulates
Wang
Yunkun
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of
compensated
land
and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State
Council
or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens
or
hundreds
of
years
he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures
from
the
report
showed
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for

The

are
set

Tmall

billion

in

a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the

in

did
not
say
how
much

share
the

accounted
for
more

70

of

to
Web

in
the

from

Although
their

the

online

will
be
able
to

In

the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's
e-commerce
industry
is
set
to
decline
in
the
coming

partly
because

will
find
it

official
in
Jabhat

leadership
in

area
the
35-year-old
had
a
ready
answer
for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We
know
the
West
and
its
oppressive
ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N
Security
Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity

That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after

tagger
attached
to
their

The

in

outside

stopped
in

There
were

Adnan

silently
approached

car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not

himself
until
I
asked

he
was

We
drove
to
a
small
cold

with
a

that
barely

of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de
guerre
of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
Israel
The
U.S
Treasury
Department
has
also
slapped
financial
sanctions
against
two
men
it
believes
are
senior
leaders
in
the
militia
group
Maysar
Ali
Musa
Abdallah
al-Juburi
and
Anas
Hasan
Khattab
Recent
media
reports
also
mention
one
Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
to
bakeries
We
are
keeping
the
price
of
bread
at
15
lira
about
21
U.S
cents
which
was
its
true
price
Abu
Adnan
said
adding
that
transgressors
would
be
punished
according
to
Shari¡®a
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
also
thus
far
avoided
indiscriminate
civilian
casualties
That¡¯s
not
to
say
that
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
have
fierce
critics
especially
within
rebel
circles
In
addition
to
its
civilian
detractors
many
more
secular-minded
fighters
are
wary
of
the
group¡¯s
social
conservatism
but
insist
that
its
brand
of
ultraconservative
Islam
will
not
find
a
home
in
any
post-Assad
Syria
These
fighters
often
say
that
they
will
deal
with
conservative
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
later
but
that
right
now
they
need
them
in
the
fight
against
Assad
Other
rebels
view
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
a
transient
jihadi
group
that
will
move
onto
foreign
fronts
like
Afghanistan
or
Gaza
after
the
fall
of
Assad
Abu
Adnan
smirked
when
asked
to
comment
about
such
sentiments
especially
by
fellow
Sunni
fighters
whom
he
dismissed
as
the
brainwashed
He
repeated
that
the
idea
that
we
are
a
global
organization
or
that
we
have
some
other
goal
elsewhere
after
the
fall
is
not
true
He
was
emphatic
We
are
Syrians
He
admitted
that
we
also
have
foreigners
who
came
from
other
countries
but
he
explained
that
is
because
the
wounds
in
the
Arab
lands
are
the
same
wound
and
the
oppression
is
the
same
oppression
A
minute
I
always
feel
so
long
Think
of
me
and
your
chance
Less
and
less
as
if
by
the
end
of
life
We
separate
with
each
other
The
world
of
two
people
each
other
again
A
minute
I'm
drunk
wine
a
few
times
The
evening
of
that
day
I'm
a
night
did
not
return
you
want
to
A
minute
Appear
in
front
of
you
you
want
me
to
repent
But
time
constraints
no
waiting
a
minute
Is
the
morning
you
find
I'm
a
night
that
night
Who
knows
in
the
noon
time
I
am
the
soft
bed
happy
to
sleep
But
you
have
to
use
a
minute
Wake
me
up
the
rumble
of
the
scolded
I
feel
very
feel
shy
When
I
want
to
take
a
minute
to
make
up
But
you
never
give
me
a
chance
And
you
say
we
are
the
best
choice
to
leave
I
used
a
few
years
time
Build
a
charming
scenery
wall
And
now
you
say
collapse
will
collapse
I'm
unwilling
heart
want
to
take
a
minute
To
redeem
my
fault
I
beg
you
said
to
me
Not
I
do
not
give
you
the
opportunity
But
given
the
opportunity
you
have
to
cherish
So
we
each
other
to
leave
for
good
That
night
the
minutes
But
it
doesn't
make
you
took
from
my
dreams
May
the
minute
for
you
Is
already
in
the
past
for
me
A
minute
is
an
indelible
scar
Forever
in
your
heart
the
brand
mark
The
nine
seven
half
of
the
year
I
graduated
from
the
primary
school
took
more
than
two
months
holiday
oneself
in
boring
boring
nothing
for
me
to
do
Probably
because
I
was
in
primary
school
has
over
two
times
the
level
or
that
I
was
in
the
primary
school
stage
without
ambition
my
result
difference
make
them
disappointed
disappointed
again
in
helpless
situation
teachers
do
not
stay
in
my
class
From
the
beginning
to
repeat
things
because
be
informed
parents
I
have
the
opinion
very
much
but
that
s
not
for
me
to
say
but
parents
and
teachers
say
so
in
the
two
years
younger
than
I
classmates
together
side
by
side
I
was
very
uncomfortable
psychological
also
feel
very
guilty
Only
this
guilt
and
inner
pain
no
one
can
imagine
Then
to
the
junior
high
school
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
neighborhood
folks
have
advised
me
not
to
read
so
I
went
to
town
to
work
I
seem
to
be
somewhat
unwilling
heart
did
not
listen
to
their
opinions
and
think
of
reading
mind
reading
do
not
know
what
may
I
feel
lonely
stay
in
the
quiet
village
households
seem
dismal
alone
let
me
feel
very
afraid
so
I
read
no
matter
how
bad
but
also
to
the
nine
year
compulsory
education
school
But
I
think
the
day
time
is
long
etc
several
day
has
not
yet
come
psychological
anxious
Sometimes
I'm
afraid
aunt
nagging
uncle's
house
did
not
dare
to
go
have
been
at
home
with
And
from
that
time
I
love
to
read
a
Book
habits
mother's
good
at
saying
you
read
a
book
are
admitted
to
a
university
so
you
really
go
to
read
a
book
you
don't
read
I
was
so
mom
a
nag
well
I
hate
to
take
all
of
the
book
to
burn
My
graduation
exam
is
over
a
long
time
I
didn't
know
how
to
grade
their
own
have
been
waiting
when
my
anxiety
to
fifth
days
at
the
same
time
the
junior
middle
school
admission
notice
to
can
not
write
performance
I
can
not
find
out
their
performance
is
bad
or
good
not
over
the
admission
notice
I
was
happy
but
when
the
notice
it
but
found
that
there
was
no
money
at
home
for
me
to
read
and
I
feel
it
This
day
Friday

as
I
gather
books

and
left
me
and
my
mother

Father

hard
a
week
later
did
not
wait
for
the
dad
who
come
back
home
I
was
boring
occasionally
also
help
mother
do
some
housework
but
most
of
the
time
I
am
a
person
sits
on
the
bed
or
on
the
wheelchair
When
I
was
home
to
sit
to
uncle
home
to
flow
because
the
uncle's
path
is
the
only
way
which
must
be
passed
on
the
junior
high
school
so
when
the
school
in

that
I'm

serious
Aunt

angry
tone
said
your
father
outside
in
order
to
give
you
borrow
books
first
to
your
aunt's
house
he
said
the
home
to
buy
cattle
need
to
borrow
money
so
aunt
to
know
no
such
thing
so
don't
borrow
To
the
ancient
city
of
leaf
Tingjia
your
father's
friends
said
to
buy
chemical
fertilizer
to
borrow
a
little
money
Tingjia
leaves
no
he
will
go
to
your
grandma's
house
to
you
two
uncle's
house
to
borrow
your
dad
said
is
to
build
a
house
your
uncle
happened
to
encounter
village
grow
there
ask
he
once
topic
was
exposed
he
had
to
go
to
Ningbo
and
the
town
of
Evergreen
s
aunt
s
home
to
borrow
they
have
had
to
go
to
Shangjie
discussed
In
fact
I
was
really
want
to
ask
why
he
did
know
go
to
Ningbo
to
evergreen
all
be
crystal
clear
isn't
he
is
immortal
But
I
think
if
I
really
ask
those
words
do
not
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
again
I
heard
a
few
times
she
simply
said
you
don't
read
simply
go
out
work
I
thought
if
Dad
comes
back
I
can't
read
but
sometimes
I
am
unwilling
heart
no
matter
what
was
advised
in
the
school
I
had
a
few
lessons
can
comfort
my
soul
As
for
the
aunt's
words
I
don't
want
to
hear
but
also
do
not
want
to
use
it
The
school
school
for
several
days
Dad
Don't
see
at
that
time
I
was
a
little
worried
but
those
tattle
and
prate
is
not
stopped
but
also
the
diffusion
constant
at
While
I
thought
in
my
mind
my
father
come
back
and
side
wanted
dad
to
lend
money
to
come
back
I
can
take
a
good
read
I
do
not
want
to
give
up
all
of
a
sudden
but
to
no
avail
since
the
tattle
and
prate
my
heart
was
tortured
to
death
Mom
In
addition
to
complaining
that
father
outside
sometimes
also
want
to
talk
to
scold
me
maybe
she
more
recently
than
I
was
upset
so
she
wants
to
say
I
she
said
to
me
and
I
don't
chew
sound
One
day
I
went
to
his
aunt's
house
because
the
boring
to
my
aunt's
house
behind
the
bamboo
inside
to
digging
up
bamboo
shoots
when
I
really
dig
vigorously
suddenly
heard
the
mother's
cry
I
came
down
to
see
his
aunt
said
Daddy
things
let
s
lose
face
so
my
mother
sometimes
hard
to
explain
for
oneself
sometimes
feel
helpless
because
she
feels
she
jumped
into
the
the
Yellow
River
wash
not
clear
so
she
felt
wronged
cry
In
fact
say
mother
instigated
is
possible
the
key
is
my
own
request
forcing
the
father
in
the
back
of
the
eternal
infamy
to
say
in
the
final
analysis
is
my
fault
so
I
ought
to
I
heard
my
mother
weeping
I
also
feel
very
sad
This
a
few
days
later
mother's
mood
has
not
been
good
if
not
more
I
see
my
mother
like
this
is
very
worried
After
a
few
days
of
school
another
week
has
passed
I
also
miss
dad
Don't
know
Dad

doing
may
be

most
X

on
the
evening

nearly
down
hill
Dad
came
back
I
go
first

like
my
father

several
years
not

such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
say
uncle
s
contribution
but
not
all
because
I
have
three
hundred
yuan
to
make
books
uncle
didn't
go
with
me
in
the
said
dad
before
he
has
not
called
me
to
junior
high
school
but
a
three
again
three
advised
me
to
give
up
reading
now
papa
got
money
made
a
part
of
my
books
I
read
to
say
to
their
credit
is
a
little
exaggerated
Father
left
home
also
no
rest
was
mother
shouted
did
mother's
grievance
venting
gas
while
the
father
was
annoyed
do
not
know

Mother
said

Dad
shouted

that
To

said
that
You

me
a
call
My
accusers
Mother
said
without
confrontation

spread
to
open
You

You're

Dad
said
Mother
said
your
sister-in-law
also
said
do
not
believe
you
can
go
and
ask
him
do
their
own
things
to
know
Later
my
father
also
do
not
know
to
have
to
confront
this
thing
Buleerle
But
the
father
and
mother
are
very
long
time
had
not
spoken
always
keep
silence
state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
very
so
stay
at
home
for
too
long
you
feel
so
lonely
and
boring
parents
also
I
have
no
job
but
feel
puzzled
think
it
over
and
over
again
had
no
friends
who
can
help
me
introduce
then
find
the
parents
remember
my
cousin
D
s
so
that
when
they
think
of
commissioned
sister-in-law
R's
called

me
to
the

work
F

located
on
the
edge
of
the
Fuchun
River
the
most
difficult
beautiful

also
my
hometown

center
Although
the
city
as
it
is
my
most
beautiful
dream
also
is
I
most
look
forward
to
come
to
one
of
the
city
but
because

economically
not
rich
or
because
I
was
in
the
city
without
known
relatives
so
only
stayed
in
the
countryside
most
lifetime
until
since
junior
high
school
lost

I
forced
to
quit

but
in
the

for
half
a
year
have
the
honor
to
the
D

lead
I
first
came
to
the
city
to
work
Since
D

hear
my
boring
at
home
after
the
state

was
in
the
very
next
day
morning
speeding
and
returned
to
his
hometown
urged
me
to
go
to
the
city
to
do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or
promises
probably
at
that
time
I
have
been
in
the
dream
of
the
life
in
the
city
there's
nothing
to
refuse
the
And

that
day
in
the
evening
mother

while
sewing

of
a
hole
while
another

told
me
A
Cheng
You

to
your
cousin's
arrangement
don't
go
out
on
a
night
out
that
will
make
your
brother
worry
will
let
us
worry
there
is
the
question
of
your
life
must
be
well
orderly
and
you
wear
and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother
and
friends
will
look
down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said
you
know
now
but
really
to
the
city
after
you
is
it
right
Our
words
as
unheeded
advice
that
an
inlet
and
an
outlet
to
forget
about
and
do
I
hope
you
not
if
you
so
dad
wouldn't
want
to
control
you
The
night
his
father
for
the
first
time
to
drink
is
also
the
first
time
that
I
drank
tincture
MOET
drunk
I
in
the
night
imperceptibly
in
wheezing
to
sleep
Early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
I
also
in
outdoor
breathe
fresh
air
waiting
for
mother
made
breakfast
eat
a
good
meal
with
my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also
can
Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or
accept
it
D's
said
rest
assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her
I
will
give
him
his
money
saved
in
the
home
My
father
put
the
money
back
pocket
looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
that
here
was
the
last
miss
that
my
heart
is
full
of
hope
full
of
ideals
is
my
nostalgia
reminds
me
of
the
beauty
of
my
hometown
As
tears
like
springs
that
my
surging
mood
as
in
heaven
so
here
swear
resolutely
obey
D's
command
I
went
to
Lake
source
direction
to
horse
sword
shift
car
went
straight
to
the
F
town
Go
forward
with
great
strength
and
vigour
to
the
F
city
F
City
we
in
the
long-distance
passenger
station
of
the
car
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
city
I
think
it's
great
it
is
because
I
first
saw
the
perfect
city
probably
for
the
city
people
the
city
is
not
big
because
there
are
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
such
as
Shanghai
Hangzhou
Nanjing
are
so
But
I
look
I
see
it
is
because
I
have
no
contact
with
the
city
and
the
first
contact
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
novelty
I
felt
that
here
is
my
dream
of
heaven
D
s
first
got
out
of
the
car
I
have
to
get
off
the
streets
together
with
him
I
don't
know
what
this
is
what
Lane
Road
always
feel
in
the
alley
as
in
gossip
so
I
feel
I
can't
touch
the
North
East
and
touched
the
East
has
touched
the
north
deeply
he
was
puzzled
When
I
came
to
a
river
river
sides
erected
a
high-rise
blocks
I
always
thought
that
this
is
the
Fuchun
River
I
really
think
you
saw
the
Fuchun
River
I
was
a
sigh
and
said
the
Fuchun
River
does
not
have
such
a
river
I
didn't
necessarily
it
big
D's
said
this
is
not
the
Fuchun
River
but
an
amaranth
Pujiang
I
said
oh
It
is
my
illusion
Words
I
am
his
behind
but
when
we
are
at
the
crossroads
in
the
middle
turn
right
this
is
a
long
hill
road
Liuzhou
Road
building
is
bristly
and
let
me
feel
the
perfect
city
economy
is
thriving
and
prosperous
each
poineering
hardships
may
make
it
difficult
to
imagine
as
I
came
to
a
world
came
to
a
childhood
paradise
I
see
a
paradise
of
dream
in
my
nose
to
dazzle
along
the
road
of
hill
of
dragon
of
the
past
it
is
a
city
surrounded
by
people
in
and
out
of
the
mall
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
in
the
commercial
city
upstairs
to
write
the
Fuchun
River
commercial
city
it
seems
like
I
know
this
is
F
the
city's
most
bustling
shopping
center
the
most
bustling
sidewalks
I
just
want
to
say
the
city
of
F
F
really
great
I
came
to
this
strange
city
I
really
feel
in
this
strange
city
I
can
absorb
your
sunny
temperament
to
be
a
city
that
the
giants
I
am
going
to
show
themselves
When
I
didn't
see
enough
outside
downtown
scene
I
was
D's
to
the
commercial
city
there
are
all
the
stalls
food
stands
above
the
green
vegetables
eggplant
garlic
onion
bean
curd
a
kind
sister
church
where
D's
stall
led
me
here
and
sister
chatted
a
while
when
the
elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
is
to
eat
lunch
saw
us
big
brother
put
down
his
chopsticks
call
us
to
sit
down
then
O
O
said
A
Cheng
Your
dinner
have
you
had
dinner
yet
I
haven't
answered
D's
for
I
said
we
have
no
Big
brother
says
here
to
eat
not
home
to
burn
She
also
said
yes
Or
here
to
eat
even
home
to
burn
much
trouble
D's
said
not
so
polite
home
to
burn
it
it
didn't
take
long
very
fast
He
made
the
remarks
at
the
same
time
I
still
look
around
because
I
see
here
is
such
a
big
stall
is
also
the
first
time
saw
so
many
dishes
people
buy
vegetable
stall
So
my
curiosity
in
here
is
not
fun
When
I
put
the
spirit
are
concentrated
in
the
food
stalls
of
things
he
finished
on
the
go
I'm
still
hazy
a
bit
at
a
loss
situation
he
said
to
me
A
Cheng
we
go
I
didn't
hear
there
is
one
point
be
absent-minded
look
he
coaxed
out
of
said
hello
What's
on
your
mind
Told
you
so
loudly
did
not
hear
Go
I
said
oh
Elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
to
pick
some
fresh
vegetables
let
you
bring
us
back
to
cook
he
and
I
left
sister
they
couple
booth
then
to
another
butcher
shop
stall
bought
several
kilograms
of
meat
left
the
commercial
city
and
imperceptibly
and
through
a
Malaysian
Road
came
to
a
named
Zhou
Jianong
lane
across
the
alley
alley
went
to
D's
house
D's
house
is
an
underground
garage
inside
a
very
the
smell
is
also
important
I
very
want
to
move
out
but
I
will
not
economic
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
environment
here
it
is
the
parents
of
thousand
exhort
enjoin
let
I
firmly
remember
them
you
want
me
to
listen
to
D's
so
I
had
to
reluctantly
stay
When
I
walked
inside
the
heat
from
the
outside
directly
to
heaven
so
I
really
feel
it's
hard
I
am
afraid
went
into
the
furnace
of
the
house
let
me
really
angry
be
ashamed
of
dying
When
I
was
in
the
hot
sun
dried
by
the
sun
at
the
same
time
D's
said
why
don't
you
come
in
Quickly
Wash
dishes
I
went
to
go
say
to
him
it
is
too
hot
I
have
a
bit
of
a
bear
D's
continued
hot
A
fan
Do
not
be
afraid
of
heat
a
long
time
to
get
over
I
come
too
but
we
insist
on
the
stand
A
man
should
be
afraid
of
tired
we
are
so
out
of
practice
I
said
oh
Came
to
give
him
food
finished
lunch
he's
out
let
me
have
a
rest
at
home
for
a
day
starting
tomorrow
I
promised
D's
a
boring
also
have
a
look
at
the
room
television
occasionally
to
bring
home
the
story
books
doubled
the
old
warm
up
in
primary
and
secondary
schools
the
residual
reading
difficulty
One
day
in
the
imperceptibly
in
the
past
soon
arrived
at
dusk
D's
also
returned
to
cook
I
don't
know
how
to
cook
so
there
are
a
lot
of
housework
is
D's
one
person
to
complete
I
can
only
one
wash
dishes
clean
the
room
health
or
what
other
are
not
good
At
night
after
dinner
D's
and
I
had
to
watch
TV
in
bed
TV
also
is
no
good
program
I
watched
a
imperceptibly
fell
asleep
Suddenly
I
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
I
will
readily
but
here
I
can
not
find
the
toilet
was
anxious
to
panic
I
find
that
I
finally
find
convenient
corner
when
I
finished
returned
was
a
patrol
car
through
here
I
was
found
by
police
as
a
thief
was
caught
The
car
out
of
the
two
patrol
to
check
my
ID
card
I
came
to
the
interior
from
my
bag
show
identity
cards
to
give
them
they
took
out
the
register
put
my
name
and
identity
card
number
is
recorded
in
it
and
again
and
again
I
ask
my
family
and
address
then
they
contact
D
s
asked
his
identity
asked
his
work
address
information
is
very
detailed
and
they
have
put
D
s
identity
as
a
pledge
export
to
a
television
set
let
him
leave
the
TV
invoice
and
specifications
to
verify
can
put
his
things
he
returned
to
the
He
had
to
accept
to
let
them
D's
until
the
patrol
had
gone
he
said
how
can
you
not
carefully
let
the
guard
discovered
I
said
I
don't
know
How
do
I
know
the
night
police
so
fiercely
knew
that
I
wouldn't
back
out
D's
continued
next
to
a
sharp
point
don't
be
so
idiotic
Know
or
not
Said
oh
Know
Put
out
the
light
then
we
sleep
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
sleep
at
night
because
the
room
was
at
night
is
also
very
difficult
to
eliminate
unless
the
outside
temperature
drops
to
the
upper
20s
degrees
after
midnight
there
may
be
more
comfortable
Wake
up
the
first
thing
I
do
is
to
wash
brush
work
then
I
put
a
few
of
the
ash
bucket
and
a
large
shovels
and
in
D
s
back
leading
me
to
play
first
In
fact
I
don't
know
what
is
hard
what
is
helpless
life
I
have
not
try
at
home
parents
regard
me
as
a
saint
as
for
at
that
time
I
feel
so
blessed
and
now
I
can
only
obey
D's
leadership
as
his
apprentice
I
came
to
the
city
gates
then
turn
to
the
Old
Road
South
Gate
Street
South

rely
on
the
Fuchun
River
and
that
a
large
river
it
is
the
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
we
stand
position
is
the
Fuchun
River
ferry
terminal
just
because
it
is
against
the
direction
of
the
city

the
South
so
it
means
draw
road
also
known
as
South
Gate
Street
near
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
I
came
here
did
not
look
at
the
moon
not
here
on
vacation
trip
or
something
I
was
just
a
young
worker
come
to
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
many-storied
buildings
work
most
beautiful
the
Fuchun

river
I
and
it
are
not
fate
I
climbed
to
the
six
floor
of
this
building
opened
the
door
there
are
several
woodworking
early
start
working
here
their
decoration
process
of
half
I
come
here
only
a
toilet
and
a
wing
not
paved
tiles
This
is
D
s
and
I
started
to
do
it
My
first
day
at
work
is
to
carry
cement
bag
or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too
much
I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
is
D
s
wake
me
from
this
dream
urged
me
to
go
to
work
I
mistily
mistily
to
get
up
go
to
work
work
on
the
path
of
two
feet
in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a
little
be
petrified
like
How
can
I
not
to
mention
the
spirit
Seems
to
me
the
wholeEven
if
more
magnificent
rhetoric
Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk
the
voice
Beat
the
floor
Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me

I
learned
to
language
in
the
river
The
first
word-mom
How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only
for

Breeze
send
me
to
sleep
But
regardless
of
the
eyebrows
climb
sweat
poured
Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite
write
of
word
Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
and
vertical
dignified
and
imposing
You
said
that
a
man
have
to
like
it
Young
i
was
not
sensible
Occasionally
make
a
mistake
You
taught
me
the
force
of
justice
I
keep
in
mind
your
word
Dare
not
have
a
bit
slight
In
order
to
build
a
quiet
environment
for
my
studies
The
already
heavy
burden
of
the
family
You
take
on
all
the
housework
and
farm
work
Even
if
was
too
tired
to
take
a
breath
Also
won't
let
me
take
part
in
I
was
moved
to
nothing
to
say
In
my
memory
You've
never

You

what
is
bitter
What
is

On

And

to
regain
the
light
when
injustice

resentment
All

don't

me
Only

In

They
be
in
a

to
depart
put
me
off
like

Occasionally
someone
stopped

at
me

Guo
Jingming
said
my
friends
are
my
courage
to
live
and
they
give
me
your
ability
let
me
face
this
world
no
longer
panic
Those
who
have
and
be
crazy
with
me
with
sadness
with
cycling
through
the
thin
youth
friend
I
think
we
all
remember
the
youth
is
how
we
face
cannot
erase
the
traces
Xiao

went
to
Hainan
in
a

Whenever
we
have
a

her
phone
call
she
received
the
text
message
she
always
likes
to
write
very
long
As
it
was
she
knew
I
was
a
very
insecure
afraid
to
lose
even
if
there
is
no
important
will
also
write
a
long
message
let
me
know
her
by
my
side
never
leave
Chen
is
a
very
clever
girl
but
in
the
study
does
not
enlighten
after
each
test
there
will
always
be
that
her
poor
grades
in
my
front
side
into
my
mouth
ice
cream
a
begged
me
to
help
her
with
We
have
been
together
for
9
years
so
only
a
piece
of
memory
I
always
thought
she
was
a
bright
child
happy
and
simple
life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
From
the
bright
sunlight
If
the
rain
from
the
cloud
Break
your
pride
Think
of
my
love
for
you
And
everything
shall
be
fine
Let
us
soar
let
us
fly
To
the
highest
height
And
everything
shall
be
fineLast
year
the
cancer
nearly
finished
me
off
However
with
the
accompaniment
of
my
best
friend
Candice
I
could
eventually
get
through
these
tough
time
Sometimes
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
always
stand
by
my
side
Last
summer
the
doctor
discovered
that
I
suffered
from
lung
cancer
At
that
moment
I
was
completely
shocked
All
memories
that
I
have
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
in
seconds
I
thought
I
was
going
to
leave
all
my
friends
my
family
and
all
people
I
loved
To
me
the
whole
world
was
just
sinking
Luckily
that
was
just
in
an
early
stage
and
the
doctor
said
that
I
had
I
great
chance
to
recover
after
a
series
of
treatments
But
he
warned
me
that
the
treatment
would
be
very
tough
and
painful
At
first
I
have
considered
to
refuse
the
treatment
However
after
I
have
though
about
all
of
my
valuable
friends
and
my
mom
and
dad
I
chose
to
take
the
chance
During
the
treatment
I
gradually
suffered
from
the
side
effects
The
number
of
hairs
on
my
head
declined
and
I
vomited
from
dawn
till
night
on
every
single
day
I
had
a
very
poor
appetite
and
I
nearly
had
no
desired
to
put
any
food
to
my
mouth
I
was
very
painful
and
I
was
thinking
about
giving
up
the
treatment
I
though
I
could
not
tolerate
it
anymore
However
with
the
support
and
encouragement
from
my
best
friend
Candice
I
have
eventually
made
it
through
the
rain
and
stand
up
once
again
Finally
I
recovered
One
summer
night
Candice
came
to
the
hospital
to
visit
me
We
sat
on
the
bench
that
facing
the
sea
The
sun
was
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
night
descended
We
chatted
underneath
the
stars
We
have
not
met
each
other
since
the
graduation
Candice
said
with
tears
on
her
face
Yes
I
have
never
thought
we
would
have
the
reunion
in
the
situation
I
said
She
kept
silent
with
her
tears
in
the
warm
gentle
breeze
We
have
been
best
friends
since
we
were
small
I
do
not
want
this
friendship
to
end
up
so
soon
She
cried
desperately
Zach
you
are
a
man
You
are
a
man
who
is
courageous
and
adventurous
You
should
have
that
guts
to
fight
for
your
life
and
people
around
you
But
Now
I
am
going
to
give
you
the
courage
you
need
She
lay
her
hand
on
me
Lord
please
give
this
little
boy
love
and
hope
to
face
the
obstacle
that
he
is
now
facing
Please
give
him
courage
to
help
him
to
find
the
way
Now
you
have
already
possessed
the
ability
to
fight
this
war
You
should
never
give
up
as
there
is
a
light
in
your
heart
and
shines
very
brightly
Since
them
I
understand
that
when
fate
is
tough
just
toughen
your
faith
With
a
smile
I
know
I
could
face
the
future
no
matter
what
lay
ahead
And
there's
a
hero
comes
along
with
the
strength
to
carry
on
My
dad
has
always
used
this
song
to
encourage
me
Until
he
passed
away
I
still
keep
this
song
in
my
iPod
and
listen
to
it
when
I
need
to
get
through
some
tough
time
To
me
this
song
does
not
only
symbolize
the
spirit
of
my
dad
but
also
mine
This
song
is
ubiquitous
in
various
singing
competitions
Regardless
of
its
singing
technique
the
beautiful
melody
and
those
meaningful
lyrics
has
helped
many
people
to
get
through
obstacles
This
fabulous
song
was
composed
by
American
singer-songwriter
Mariah
Carey
in
1993
and
definitely
performed
by
herself
The
song
mentioned
that
among
every
single
one
of
us
a
hero
lies
inside
our
heart
If
we
try
to
reach
into
our
soul
our
emptiness
will
disappear
There's
a
hero
if
you
look
inside
your
heart
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid
of
who
you
are
When
I
was
small
I
was
a
child
who
was
so
fragile
and
cried
easily
I
was
afraid
of
everything
I
was
so
this
and
small
and
when
my
classmates
bullied
me
all
I
would
do
was
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
and
cry
from
dawn
till
night
Worse
still
I
was
poor
in
academic
result
and
no
teachers
loved
me
On
these
days
I
found
myself
useless
and
believed
that
no
one
in
this
world
would
recognise
this
small
potato
I
was
so
desperate
Yet
in
one
dark
night
my
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
hand
was
so
large
and
warm
All
I
could
feel
was
the
love
and
hope
transmitted
through
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
and
to
my
heart
and
soul
Son
you
should
not
be
fragile
anymore
But
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
Now
I
am
going
to
recall
your
hero
from
your
soul
and
from
now
on
you
would
never
feel
lonely
anymore
My
hero
and
your
hero
have
already
stayed
together
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
Other
people
can
say
anything
they
want
to
say
Although
they
try
to
bring
you
down
you
will
never
allow
them
to
do
so
because
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
This
hero
will
always
stay
close
to
you
and
protect
you
forever
Afterwards
he
sang
this
song
to
me
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow
But
don't
let
anyone
to
tear
them
away
Since
then
whenever
I
need
to
face
any
problems
or
obstacles
alone
I
will
not
be
fragile
anymore
All
I
need
to
do
is
sing
Hero
along
with
my
hero
and
my
father's
hero
and
I
will
certainly
know
that
my
father
will
guide
me
where
I
should
go
I
know
that
there
is
a
light
in
me
and
shines
very
brightly
and
other
people
can
try
but
they
can
never
take
that
away
from
me
The
meeting
is
WangHai
Time
always
unknowingly
hurried
away
flash
Also
in
the
online
to
spend
a
few
years
Cry
also
laughed
Thousands
of
day
and
night
WangHai
roaming
A
thought
to
mature
Walk
to
the
friend
go
to
How
many
friends
already
not
disappear
Sitting
alone
in
the
space
is
cold
and
cheerless
Some
vague
sad
loss
Thankfully
Have
a
lot
of
friends
have
been
silent
about
Accompany
me
along
the
way
Always
buchibuqi
In
the
virtual

Deduce
true
feelings
Behind
the
screen
in

And
each
wish
Whenever

Will
receive
blessings
of
friends
Very
often
I

Because
of
you
Lonely

Because

you
My

is

Of
a

I

My

Thousands
of

a
moment
of

Don't

Both
you
and
I
Thank
you
all

embarrassed
in
front
of
your
friends
When

anyone
You
thanked
her
by
saying
It's
none
of
your
business
When
you
were

she
suggested
certain

You

like

When

burden
parents

to
their
children
And
then
one
day
she
quietly
died
And
everything
you
never
did
came
crashing
down
like
thunder
Rock
me
baby
rock
me
all
night
long
The
hand
who
rocks
the
cradle...may
rock
the
world
Let
us
take
a
moment
of
the
time
just
to
pay
tribute
and
show
appreciation
to
the
person
called
mom
though
some
may
not
say
it
openly
to
their
mother
There's
no
substitute
for
her
Cherish
every
single
moment
Though
at
times
she
may
not
be
the
best
of
friends
may
not
agree
to
our
thoughts
she
is
still
your
mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left
Thomas
Carlyle
lived
from
1795
until
1881
He
was
a
10000
wow
gold
Scot
essayist
and
historian
During
his
lifetime
he
became
one
of
the
world's
greatest
writers
But
he
was
a
human
and
storage
rack

mistakes
On
October

1826
wow

paypal
Carlyle
married
his
secretary
Jane
Welsh
She
was
an
intelligent
attractive
and
somewhat
temperamental
daughter
of
a
well-to-do
doctor
They
had
their
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
but
still
loved
Bathroom
Vanities
each
other
dearly
After
their
marriage
Jane
continued
to
serve
as
his
secretary
But
after
several
years
of
marriage
Jane
became
ill
Being
Bathroom
Mirrors
a
hard
worker
Carlyle
became
so
absorbed
in
his
writings
that
he
let
Jane
continue
working
for
several
weeks
after
she
became
ill
She
had
cancer
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
slow
growing
kind
she
finally
became
confined
to
her
bed
Although
Carlyle
loved
her
Bathroom
Accessories
dearly
he
very
seldom
found
time
to
stay
with
her
long
He
was
busy
with
his
work
when
Jane
died
they
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
for
the
service
The
day
Glass
Basin
was
a
miserable
day
It
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
Following
the
funeral
Carlyle
went
back
to
his
home
He
was
taking
it
pretty
hard
He
went
up
the
stairs
to
Jane's
room
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
her
bed
He
sat
there
thinking
Shower
Enclosures
about
how
little
time
he
had
spent
with
her
and
wishing
so
much
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
differently
Noticing
her
diary
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
picked
it
up
and
began
to
steel
shelving
read
it
Suddenly
he
seemed
shocked
He
saw
it
There
on
one
page
she
had
written
Interior
Doors
a
single
line
Yesterday
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
and
it
was
like
heaven
I
love
him
so
Something
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
He
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
that
he
meant
so
much
to
her
He
thought
of
all
wow
gold
australia
the
times
he
had
gone
about
his
work
without
thinking
about
and
noticing
her
Then
Carlyle
turned
the
page
in
the
diary
There
he
noticed
she
racking
had
written
some
words
that
broke
his
heart
I
have
listened
all
day
to
hear
his
steps
in
the
hall
but
now
it
is
late
and
I
guess
he
won't
come
today
Carlyle
read
a
little
more
in
the
book
Then
he
threw
it
down
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Some
of
his
friends
found
him
at
the
grave
his
buy
wow
gold
australia
face
buried
in
the
mud
His
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
Tears
continued
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
He
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
If
I
had
only
known
if
I
had
only
known
But
it
was
too
late
for
Carlyle
She
was
dead
After
Jane's
death
Carlyle
made
world
of
warcraft
gold
for
sale
little
attempt
to
write
again
The
historians
say
he
lived
another
15
years
weary
bored
and
a
partial
recluse
I
share
the
story
with
in
the
hope
that
you
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
While
our
loved
ones
must
have
the
money
we
make
to
live
it
is
the
love
we
have
that
they
really
want
Give
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
It
is
not
easy
to
define
what
kind
of
meaning
to
the
enterprise
culture
because
the
enterpise
culture
stems
from
the
ration
and
reality
which
should
be
related
to
the
regulations
or
how
to
react
to
the
risk
of
management
or
market
instead
of
just
focusing
on
training
and
meeting
which
should
be
related
to
the
proportion
of
thoughts
of
belonging
to
our
company
and
benefitting
our
company
in
the
difficulty
Sometimes
the
puzzled
people
are
always
in
the
mess
of
understanding
of
why
the
itemized
regulations
could
not
optimize
the
operation
and
not
regulate
the
action
of
some
officials
who
always
abused
the
power
to
benefit
themselves
which
lead
to
the
argument
that
as
long
as
the
company
is
so
large
that
the
culture
of
enterprise
is
absolutly
difficult
to
be
built
up
Different
people
with
different
education
background
and
different
comprehension
of
society
would
not
be
integrated
to
the
common
recognition
of
enterprise
culture
which
is
the
crux
to
help
the
company
be
prosperous
In
spite
of
training
many
officials
there
are
lots
of
bottlenecks
which
should
be
smoothed
and
holes
which
should
be
covered
so
we
must
work
out
some
measures
to
make
our
company
step
on
the
right
road
Regulations
are
parts
of
the
enterprise
culture
making
the
road
straight
but
what
kind
of
regulations
are
suitful
to
the
state-owned
company
The
regulation
are
always
eroded
by
dereliction
and
are
not
always
strickly
implemented
by
some
departments
Frankly
speaking
the
enterprise
culture
is
just
having
some
aspects
in
consciousness
frequently
dominating
the
behavior
which
would
give
us
some
reference
on
how
to
enact
the
detailed
regulations
could
get
the
return
as
expected
The
most
important
thing
related
to
the
enterprise
culture
is
how
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
in
the
every
respect
of
operation
We
must
detail
every
process
of
how
to
control
the
cost
and
how
to
make
the
work
efficient
and
rational
If
employee
could
make
their
regulations
rooted
in
mind
they
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
keep
them
from
dereliction
and
would
try
their
best
to
devote
the
wisdom
to
benifitting
our
company.For
example
The
flaws
in
human
nature
and
the
shortage
of
wealth
would
seduce
the
officals
to
accept
the
secret
money
from
agencies
who
are
intended
to
pull
down
the
officals
by
all
kinds
of
tactics
and
if
the
officals
are
too
fragile
to
resist
the
gifts
they
would
be
united
with
agencies
to
cheat
our
company
so
the
task
which
brooks
no
delay
is
the
education
brainwashing
and
making
the
severe
punishment
happen
without
them
the
enterprise
culture
is
like
the
moon
in
water
like
the
flowers
in
mist
like
the
stupid
being
called
clever
What
is
the
quintessence
of
the
enterprise
culture
It
is
easy
or
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
conclusion
because
it
is
a
hard
job
to
change
people¡¯s
mindset
which
is
always
in
the
prejustice.So
at
first
we
must
scrutinize
the
origin
of
the
prejustice
why
are
so
many
people
always
just
negating
others
because
we
are
extremely
lack
of
communication
to
understand
with
each
other
lacking
of
wisdom
to
tell
the
right
and
the
wrong
lacking
of
the
wide
chest
to
tolerate
the
different
ideas
wnich
lead
to
misunderstand
among
people
and
to
form
the
impasse
to
flexibly
resolve
the
thorny
problem.There
are
some
words
similar
and

the

in

such
as

giving
us
some
metaphor
or
euphemism
that
enterprise
culture
must
depend
on
the
communication
cooperation
must
control
the
ridiculous
behavior
of
some
officials
must
concoct
the
atmosphere
from
stiff
suffocated
environment
to
the
active
creative
philosophical
philanthropic
state
of
mindset
of
everyone.But
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
behavior
spontaneously
follow
the
bright
side
of
human
being
just
because
of
the
fragile
and
selfish
nature
of
people
with
some
ignorant
knowledge
about
themselves
so
using
the
regulations
to
control
the
devil
in
their
mindset
and
encouraging
the
bold
attitude
to
resolve
the
present
and
history
problem
is
the
essential
way
of
making
the
enterprise
culture
alive
and
giving
the
light
to
the
employee
We
must
change
the
thoughts
that
we
are
isolated
by
others
we
are
just
living
for
ourself
we
are
just
focusing
on
our
private
cases
to
the
thoughts
that
if
we
can
help
each
other
if
we
believe
in
the
philosophy
of
strengthenning
the
consciousness
of
doing
the
job
positively
and
wisely
getting
good
return
we
can
achieve
the
goal
of
making
our
company
profitful
and
competitive
even
making
our
life
happy
Why
are
the
employee
always
having
no
enthusiasm
and
lacking
of
a
little
responsibility
in
their
job?why
are
there
lots
of
complaint
in
our
company?why
are
the
talented
people
resigning
quickly
from
our
company?Yes
the
salary
is
the
key
and
having
no
feeling
in
cooperation
unity
belonging
and
having
not
the
promising
future
are
the
fundamental
reasons
which
steamrollerred
the
spirit
to
be
loyal
to
company
so
putting
the
importance
of
employee
in
priority
is
the
way
of
having
the
high
competition
in
this
globallized
world
A
healthy
company
is
the
one
that
urgently
need
the
creative
advices
from
employee
in
stead
of
closing
their
eyes
filling
in
their
ears
in
front
of
the
employee
who
may
have
some
profound
and
pragmatic
ideas
which
maybe
benifit
to
the
operation
of
our
company.But
how
to
distinguish
the
good
ideas
or
the
wrong
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
leaders
who
must
look
through
everything
including
themselves
and
others
adding
that
they
must
comprehend
the
logic
of
mindset
and
behavior
of
themself
To
be
leaders
the
open
attitude
is
the
good
way
to
rationalize
the
management
adopting
the
positive
way
to
eliminate
the
flaws
in
the
structure
and
to
attain
the
goal
with
attacking
the
black
hands¡±
instead
of
always
being
in
defensive
measure
of
healing
the
fissure
in
management
that
is
deficient
in
courage
and
wisdom.It
is
also
one
part
of
the
enterprise
culture.Frankly
saying
having
good
return
to
our
company
is
dominated
by
the
fate
by
the
hearts
of
all
employee
by
the
regulations
by
the
rational
philosophy
by
the
authentic
wisdom
Service
is
the
culture
it
sounds
like
simple
but
complicated
and
profound
if
you
want
to
make
it
better
and
better
How
to
do
service
is
the
important
culture
of
enterprise
which
could
attract
many
people
to
take
our
flights
again
and
again.We
can
ask
a
simple
question
that
if
you
look
up
to
see
the
twinkled
stars
in
night
what
make
you
comfortable?The
answer
is
easy
the
bright
the
color
make
you
feel
comfortable
which
can
make
us
have
some
comprehension
that
if
you
make
people¡¯s
body
such
as
eye
ear
limbs
nose
heart
feel
nice
your
service
is
the
nice
service
if
you
make
the
customers
angry
you
failed
in
doing
service.So
you
must
think
over
how
to
make
the
customers
feel
better
is
the
best
way
to
learn
how
to
give
service
to
these
arrogant
and
hypercritical
customers
Above
all
We
can
understand
that
if
you
have
regulations
in
your
mindset
which
sometimes
is
selfish
and
Out
of
my
window
the
darkness
gave
me
a
signal:if
you
are
habitted
in
the
darkness
of
heart
you
would
be
dissappionted
for
ever.sometimes
I
want
to
find
the
way
of
making
me
in
the
positive
attitude
to
the
life
but
always
are
beated
by
my
experiences
which
cutted
off
the
robe
attached
to
the
sunshine.but
the
frustrated
happenning
is
not
the
domination
which
converts
my
good
intention
to
the
devil
the
domination
is
my
thoughts
which
are
sometimes
not
superficial
but
profound
gives
me
the
light
and
warm
to
live
simply
and
happily
What
kind
of
thoughts
would
release
my
pressure
and
gives
me
the
ability
to
survive
in
the
chilly
and
choppy
reality
which
would
distort
the
heart
fragile
to
the
fragmentary
condition
or
make
the
heart
wisom
strong
get
the
meaning
of
life
which
would
push
me
to
the
heaven
with
lots
of
beauty
and
full
I
would
say
that
my
thoughts
is
related
to
the
thoughts
themselves
if
you
can
change
the
thoughts
quickly
and
correctedly
you
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
pusure
the
objects
you
want;if
you
are
stubborn
enough
you
would
be
easily
defeated
by
the
fate
which
urgently
need
the
wisdom
light
to
cover
the
black
in
the
mindset
full
of
good
and
evil
When
I
was
a
child
I
do
not
know
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
and
have
no
faith
which
would
comfort
my
soul
to
give
me
a
light
would
direct
my
road
to
the
tranquillized
home
My
pressure
is
from
my
family
where
my
father
is
not
a
reasonable
person
and
had
no
ideas
on
how
to
cultivate
my
individual
personality
and
my
character
so
in
the
long
time
I
felt
the
life
of
mine
is
in
hell
even
if
I
have
food
to
eat
have
cloth
to
wear
but
my
heart
was
in
deep
frustration
and
had
much
hatre
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
shaping
my
thoughts
that
the
life
had
not
power
to
lift
me
from
the
miserable
conditions.after
long
long
time
the
climate
has
been
changed
to
more
warm
the
rivers
have
been
changed
to
more
polluted
the
hearts
of
many
people
have
been
changed
by
desire
for
money
to
be
vicious
my
god
has
given
me
the
enlight
that
if
you
can
comprehend
the
love
the
truth
you
can
have
sheft
below
the
sunshine
which
would
fill
you
and
warm
you
so
it
is
my
fortunation
I
can
get
the
hints
from
god
giving
me
the
truth
which
fattened
my
twisted
raods
in
the
mist
and
I
can
smile
happily
and
never
be
frustrated
again
Even
if
I
explain
the
understanding
of
love
and
truth
again
and
again
lots
of
people
still
had
lof
of
question
on
my
comprehension
about
the
thoughts
as
same
as
my
past.in
my
past
I
was
puzzled
intensifiedly
on
some
meaningful
words.some
people
said
to
me
the
words
wisdom
but
it
is
like
a
fool
who
can
not
distinguish
what
is
right
or
wrong
I
am
delayed
to
understand
the
truth
which
stumbled
my
existence
and
made
me
fall
to
hell.but
the
darkness
is
not
always
having
no
light
maybe
my
god
has
pity
on
me
one
day
I
found
thoughts
can
change
my
action
my
attitude
to
the
life
I
confronted
that
is
in
the
embarrassed
condition.after
I
have
been
changed
to
the
peace
life
by
the
fresh
way
of
thinking
I
can
in
confidence
make
a
conclusion
that
please
believing
in
the
god¡¯s
soul
that
tell
you
what
is
yours
what
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
this
world
worthy
pusuring
you
should
love
should
dent
the
suffering
you
have
got
and
smiling
in
the
darkness
stubborn
and
everyone
would
follow
the
regulations
rooted
in
your
heart
thinking
of
the
company
as
your
own
our
enterprise
would
be
promising.The
safety
and
service
is
the
crux
to
our
enterprise
we
must
strengthen
our
consciousness
to
keep
them
in
our
mind
and
do
our
best
to
support
it
VIRTUE
is
like
a
rich
stone
best
plain
set
and
surely
virtue
is
best
in
a
body
that
is
comely
though
not
of
delicate
features
and
that
hath
rather
dignity
of
presence
than
beauty
of
aspect
Neither
is
it
almost
seen
that
very
beautiful
persons
are
otherwise
of
great
virtue
as
if
nature
were
rather
busy
not
to
err
than
in
labor
to
produce
excellency
And
therefore
they
prove
accomplished
but
not
of
great
spirit
and
study
rather
behavior
than
virtue
But
this
holds
not
always
for
Augustus
Caesar
Titus
Vespasianus
Philip
le
Belle
of
France
Edward
the
Fourth
of
England
Alcibiades
of
Athens
Ismael
the
Sophy
of
Persia
were
all
high
and
great
spirits
and
yet
the
most
beautiful
men
of
their
times
In
beauty
that
of
favor
is
more
than
that
of
color
and
that
of
decent
and
gracious
motion
more
than
that
of
favor
That
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
cannot
express
no
nor
the
first
sight
of
the
life
There
is
no
excellent
beauty
that
hath
not
some
strangeness
in
the
proportion
A
man
cannot
tell
whether
Apelles
or
Albert
Durer
were
the
more
trifler
whereof
the
one
would
make
a
personage
by
geometrical
proportions
the
other
by
taking
the
best
parts
out
of
divers
faces
to
make
one
excellent
Such
personages
I
think
would
please
nobody
but
the
painter
that
made
them
Not
but
I
think
a
painter
may
make
a
better
face
than
ever
was
but
he
must
do
it
by
a
kind
of
felicity
as
a
musician
that
maketh
an
excellent
air
in
music
and
not
by
rule
A
man
shall
see
faces
that
if
you
examine
them
part
by
part
you
shall
find
never
a
good
and
yet
altogether
do
well
If
it
be
true
that
the
principal
part
of
beauty
is
in
decent
motion
certainly
it
is
no
marvel
though
persons
in
years
seem
many
times
more
amiable
pulchrorum
autumnus
pulcher
for
no
youth
can
be
comely
but
by
pardon
and
considering
the
youth
as
to
make
up
the
comeliness
Beauty
is
as
summer
fruits
which
are
easy
to
corrupt
and
cannot
last
and
for
the
most
part
it
makes
a
dissolute
youth
and
an
age
a
little
out
of
countenance
but
yet
certainly
again
if
it
light
well
it
maketh
virtue
shine
and
vices
blush
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
It
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land

now.""Never
lie
And
most
importantly
"You
can
do

you
have
to
do
By
my

he
wasn't
telling
me
what
to
do

which
was
scary

heady
at
the
same
time
He
provided
perspective
not
telling
me
what
was
around
the
great
corner
of
life
but
letting
me
know
there
was
a
lot
more
than
just
today
and
the
next
which
I
hadn't
thought
of
One
day
I
realize
now
there
was
a
change
I
wasn't
trying
to
please
him
so
much
as
I
was
trying
to
impress
him
I
never
asked
him
to
come
to
my
football
games
He
had
a
high-pressure
career
and
it
meant
driving
through
most
of
Friday
night
But
for
all
the
big
games
when
I
looked
over
at
the
sideline
there
was
that
familiar
fedora
And
by
God
did
the
opposing
team
captain
ever
get
a
firm
handshake
and
a
gaze
he
would
remember
Then
a
school
fact
contradicted
something
he
said
Impossible
that
he
could
be
wrong
but
there
it
was
in
the
book
These
accumulated
over
time
along
with
personal
experiences
to
buttress
my
own
developing
sense
of
values
And
I
could
tell
we
had
each
taken
our
own
perfectly
normal
paths
I
began
to
see
too
his
blind
spots
his
prejudices
and
his
weaknesses
I
never
threw
these
up
at
him
He
hadn't
to
me
and
anyway
he
seemed
to
need
protection
I
stopped
asking
his
advice
the
experiences
he
drew
from
no
longer
seemed
relevant
to
the
decisions
I
had
to
make
He
volunteered
advice
for
a
while
But
then
in
more
recent
years
politics
and
issues
gave
way
to
talk
of
empty
errands
and
always
to
ailments
From
his
bed
he
showed
me
the
many
sores
and
scars
on
his
misshapen
body
and
all
the
bottles
for
medicine
Sometimes
he
confided
I
would
just
like
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
not
wake
up
After
much
thought
and
practice
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
one
night
last
winter
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
and
remembered
for
an
instant
those
terrifying
dark
holes
in
another
house
35
years
before
I
told
my
fatherhow
much
I
loved
him
I
described
all
the
things
people
were
doing
for
him
But
I
said
he
kept
eating
poorly
hiding
in
his
room
and
violating
the
doctor's
orders
No
amount
of
love
could
make
someone
else
care
about
life
I
said
it
was
a
two-way
street
He
wasn't
doing
his
best
The
decision
was
his
He
said
he
knew
how
hard
my
words
had
been
to
say
and
how
proud
he
was
of
me
I
had
the
best
teacher
I
said
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
He
smiled
a
little
And
we
shook
hands
firmly
for
the
last
time
Several
days
later
at
about
4
A.M
my
mother
heard
Dad
shuffling
about
their
dark
room
I
have
some
things
I
have
to
do
he
said
He
paid
a
bundle
of
bills
He
composed
for
my
mother
a
long
list
of
legal
and
financial
what-to-do's
in
case
of
emergency
And
he
wrote
me
a
note
Then
he
walked
back
to
his
bed
and
laid
himself
down
He
went
to
sleep
naturally
And
he
did
not
wake
up
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days

MOSCOW
Dec
26
Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans
on
U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against
Russians
abroad
and
persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take
effect
on
Jan
1
2013
if
signed
by
the
president
into

Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov
told
local

Wednesday
that
Putin
would
consider
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
within
two
weeks
after
the
Federation
Council
approved
it

house
of
the
parliament
on
Friday
passed
the
bill
with
420

supported
by
all
the
Russians
On
Wednesday
the
Moscow
police
have
detained
four
people
near
the
Federation
Council
building
who
were
protesting
against
the
bill
Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
in
November
1989
All
member
states
are
obliged

actions
and
policies
in
the
light

the
best
interests

a
child
Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
Users
shall
be
responsible
for
reclaiming
the
same
area
and
quality
of
cultivated
land
they
use
for
construction
of
non-agricultural
projects
the
Land
Administration
Law
stipulates
Wang
Yunkun
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of
compensated
land
and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State
Council
or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens
or
hundreds
of
years
he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures
from

are
set
to

in

470
billion

in

a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the
market
in

did
not
say
how
much

share
the
nation's

going
to

accounted
for
more

70

to
Web

in
the

according
to

from

Although
their

In

the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's

industry
is
set
to
decline
in
the
coming

partly
because

will
find
it

because
of

released
the
following
day
after
a

in

His

has

A
religious
scholar
and
Shari¡®a
law
official
in
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
leadership
in
the
Aleppo
area
the
35-year-old
had
a
ready
answer
for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We
know
the
West
and
its
oppressive
ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N
Security
Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity
Smokers
need
not

A
potential
recruit
must
undertake
a
10-day
religious-training
course
to
ascertain
his
understanding
of
religion
his
morals
his
reputation
A
15-to-20-day
military-training
program
follows
That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
the
vehicle
including
Abu
Adnan
who
silently
approached
the
car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not
introduce
himself
until
I
asked
who
he
was
later
We
drove
to
a
small
cold
concrete
room
with
a
tiny
window
that
barely
let
in
any
light
from
an
already
overcast
sky
We
sat
among
boxes
of
long-life
milk
and
bags
of
blankets
and
winter
clothes
waiting
to
be
distributed
Our
host
the
driver
tried
to
start
a
portable
gas
heater
but
there
was
no
gas
America
has
called
us
terrorists
because
it
says
that
some
of
our
tactics
bear
the
fingerprints
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de
guerre
of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
Israel
The
U.S
Treasury
Department
has
also
slapped
financial
sanctions
against
two
men
it
believes
are
senior
leaders
in
the
militia
group
Maysar
Ali
Musa
Abdallah
al-Juburi
and
Anas
Hasan
Khattab
Recent
media
reports
also
mention
one
Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
to
bakeries
We
are
keeping
the
price
of
bread
at
15
lira
about
21
U.S
cents
which
was
its
true
price
Abu
Adnan
said
adding
that
transgressors
would
be
punished
according
to
Shari¡®a
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
also
thus
far
avoided
indiscriminate
civilian
casualties
That¡¯s
not
to
say
that
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
have
fierce
critics
especially
within
rebel
circles
In
addition
to
its
civilian
detractors
many
more
secular-minded
fighters
are
wary
of
the
group¡¯s
social
conservatism
but
insist
that
its
brand
of
ultraconservative
Islam
will
not
find
a
home
in
any
post-Assad
Syria
These
fighters
often
say
that
they
will
deal
with
conservative
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
later
but
that
right
now
they
need
them
in
the
fight
against
Assad
Other
rebels
view
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
a
transient
jihadi
group
that
will
move
onto
foreign
fronts
like
Afghanistan
or
Gaza
after
the
fall
of
Assad
Abu
Adnan
smirked
when
asked
to
comment
about
such
sentiments
especially
by
fellow
Sunni
fighters
whom
he
dismissed
as
the
brainwashed
He
repeated
that
the
idea
that
we
are
a
global
organization
or
that
we
have
some
other
goal
elsewhere
after
the
fall
is
not
true
He
was
emphatic
We
are
Syrians
He
admitted
that
we
also
have
foreigners
who
came
from
other
countries
but
he
explained
that
is
because
the
wounds
in
the
Arab
lands
are
the
same
wound
and
the
oppression
is
the
same
oppression
A
minute
I
always
feel
so
long
Think
of
me
and
your
chance
Less
and
less
as
if
by
the
end
of
life
We
separate
with
each
other
The
world
of
two
people
each
other
again
A
minute
I'm
drunk
wine
a
few
times
The
evening
of
that
day
I'm
a
night
did
not
return
you
want
to
A
minute
Appear
in
front
of
you
you
want
me
to
repent
But
time
constraints
no
waiting
a
minute
Is
the
morning
you
find
I'm
a
night
that
night
Who
knows
in
the
noon
time
I
am
the
soft
bed
happy
to
sleep
But
you
have
to
use
a
minute
Wake
me
up
the
rumble
of
the
scolded
I
feel
very
feel
shy
When
I
want
to
take
a
minute
to
make
up
But
you
never
give
me
a
chance
And
you
say
we
are
the
best
choice
to
leave
I
used
a
few
years
time
Build
a
charming
scenery
wall
And
now
you
say
collapse
will
collapse
I'm
unwilling
heart
want
to
take
a
minute
To
redeem
my
fault
I
beg
you
said
to
me
Not
I
do
not
give
you
the
opportunity
But
given
the
opportunity
you
have
to
cherish
So
we
each
other
to
leave
for
good
That
night
the
minutes
But
it
doesn't
make
you
took
from
my
dreams
May
the
minute
for
you
Is
already
in
the
past
for
me
A
minute
is
an
indelible
scar
Forever
in
your
heart
the
brand
mark
The
nine
seven
half
of
the
year
I
graduated
from
the
primary
school
took
more
than
two
months
holiday
oneself
in
boring
boring
nothing
for
me
to
do
Probably
because
I
was
in
primary
school
has
over
two
times
the
level
or
that
I
was
in
the
primary
school
stage
without
ambition
my
result
difference
make
them
disappointed
disappointed
again
in
helpless
situation
teachers
do
not
stay
in
my
class
From
the
beginning
to
repeat
things
because
be
informed
parents
I
have
the
opinion
very
much
but
that
s
not
for
me
to
say
but
parents
and
teachers
say
so
in
the
two
years
younger
than
I
classmates
together
side
by
side
I
was
very
uncomfortable
psychological
also
feel
very
guilty
Only
this
guilt
and
inner
pain
no
one
can
imagine
Then
to
the
junior
high
school
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
neighborhood
folks
have
advised
me
not
to
read
so
I
went
to
town
to
work
I
seem
to
be
somewhat
unwilling
heart
did
not
listen
to
their
opinions
and
think
of
reading
mind
reading
do
not
know
what
may
I
feel
lonely
stay
in
the
quiet
village
households
seem
dismal
alone
let
me
feel
very
afraid
so
I
read
no
matter
how
bad
but
also
to
the
nine
year
compulsory
education
school
But
I
think
the
day
time
is
long
etc
several
day
has
not
yet
come
psychological
anxious
Sometimes
I'm
afraid
aunt
nagging
uncle's
house
did
not
dare
to
go
have
been
at
home
with
And
from
that
time
I
love
to
read
a
Book
habits
mother's
good
at
saying
you
read
a
book
are
admitted
to
a
university
so
you
really
go
to
read
a
book
you
don't
read
I
was
so
mom
a
nag
well
I
hate
to
take
all
of
the
book
to
burn
My
graduation
exam
is
over
a
long
time
I
didn't
know
how
to
grade
their
own
have
been
waiting
when
my
anxiety
to
fifth
days
at
the
same
time
the
junior
middle
school
admission
notice
to
can
not
write
performance
I
can
not
find
out
their
performance
is
bad
or
good
not
over
the
admission
notice
I
was
happy
but
when
the
notice
it
but
found
that
there
was
no
money
at
home
for
me
to
read
and
I
feel
it
This
day
Friday
daddy
go
out
as
I
gather
books
go
home
and
left
me
and
my
mother
two
Father
outside
money
very
hard
a
week
later
did
not
wait
for
the
dad
who
come
back
home
I
was
boring
occasionally
also
help
mother
do
some
housework
but
most
of
the
time
I
am
a
person
sits
on
the
bed
or
on
the
wheelchair
When
I
was
home
to
sit
to
uncle
home
to
flow
because
the
uncle's
path
is
the
only
way
which
must
be
passed
on
the
junior
high
school
so
when
the
school
in
the
school
I'll
be
watching
them
back
and
forth
it
seems
that
I'm
reading
way
does
not
give
up
Father
borrow
money
did
not
come
back
but
the
family
tattle
and
prate
much
rise
when
aunt
in
my
ears
ago
often
nag
daddy
thing
I
feel
creepy
why
is
it
so
Dad
why
Dad
You
come
back
You
come
back
quickly
I
prefer
not
to
read
will
not
let
you
be
such
grievances
such
insults
Dad
Dad
What
are
you
Why
are
they
so
say
you
I
have
been
to
have
been
waiting
for
his
return
Aunt
said
your
father
too
do
bad
name
that
he
do
it
really
lost
your
face
For
a
start
I
don't
know
what
happened
the
mood
is
very
heavy
asked
aunt
how
Is
there
anything
so
so
serious
Aunt
aggravated
by
an
angry
tone
said
your
father
outside
in
order
to
give
you
borrow
books
first
to
your
aunt's
house
he
said
the
home
to
buy
cattle
need
to
borrow
money
so
aunt
to
know
no
such
thing
so
don't
borrow
To
the
ancient
city
of
leaf
Tingjia
your
father's
friends
said
to
buy
chemical
fertilizer
to
borrow
a
little
money
Tingjia
leaves
no
he
will
go
to
your
grandma's
house
to
you
two
uncle's
house
to
borrow
your
dad
said
is
to
build
a
house
your
uncle
happened
to
encounter
village
grow
there
ask
he
once
topic
was
exposed
he
had
to
go
to
Ningbo
and
the
town
of
Evergreen
s
aunt
s
home
to
borrow
they
have
had
to
go
to
Shangjie
discussed
In
fact
I
was
really
want
to
ask
why
he
did
know
go
to
Ningbo
to
evergreen
all
be
crystal
clear
isn't
he
is
immortal
But
I
think
if
I
really
ask
those
words
do
not
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
again
I
heard
a
few
times
she
simply
said
you
don't
read
simply
go
out
work
I
thought
if
Dad
comes
back
I
can't
read
but
sometimes
I
am
unwilling
heart
no
matter
what
was
advised
in
the
school
I
had
a
few
lessons
can
comfort
my
soul
As
for
the
aunt's
words
I
don't
want
to
hear
but
also
do
not
want
to
use
it
The
school
school
for
several
days
Dad
Don't
see
at
that
time
I
was
a
little
worried
but
those
tattle
and
prate
is
not
stopped
but
also
the
diffusion
constant
at
While
I
thought
in
my
mind
my
father
come
back
and
side
wanted
dad
to
lend
money
to
come
back
I
can
take
a
good
read
I
do
not
want
to
give
up
all
of
a
sudden
but
to
no
avail
since
the
tattle
and
prate
my
heart
was
tortured
to
death
Mom
In
addition
to
complaining
that
father
outside
sometimes
also
want
to
talk
to
scold
me
maybe
she
more
recently
than
I
was
upset
so
she
wants
to
say
I
she
said
to
me
and
I
don't
chew
sound
One
day
I
went
to
his
aunt's
house
because
the
boring
to
my
aunt's
house
behind
the
bamboo
inside
to
digging
up
bamboo
shoots
when
I
really
dig
vigorously
suddenly
heard
the
mother's
cry
I
came
down
to
see
his
aunt
said
Daddy
things
let
s
lose
face
so
my
mother
sometimes
hard
to
explain
for
oneself
sometimes
feel
helpless
because
she
feels
she
jumped
into
the
the
Yellow
River
wash
not
clear
so
she
felt
wronged
cry
In
fact
say
mother
instigated
is
possible
the
key
is
my
own
request
forcing
the
father
in
the
back
of
the
eternal
infamy
to
say
in
the
final
analysis
is
my
fault
so
I
ought
to
I
heard
my
mother
weeping
I
also
feel
very
sad
This
a
few
days
later
mother's
mood
has
not
been
good
if
not
more
I
see
my
mother
like
this
is
very
worried
After
a
few
days
of
school
another
week
has
passed
I
also
miss
dad
Don't
know
Dad
outside
doing
may
be
I
worry
most
X
x
on
the
evening
the
sun
nearly
down
hill
Dad
came
back
I
go
first
call
dad
like
my
father
and
several
years
not
to
meet
such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the

But

long

state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
very
so
stay
at
home
for
too
long
you
feel
so
lonely
and
boring
parents
also
I
have
no
job
but
feel
puzzled
think
it
over
and
over
again
had
no
friends
who
can
help
me
introduce
then
find
the
parents
remember
my
cousin
D
s

that
when
they
think
of
commissioned
sister-in-law

me
to
the

work
F

located
on
the
edge
of
the
Fuchun
River
the
most
difficult
beautiful
county

also
my
hometown

center
Although
the
city
as
it
is
my
most
beautiful
dream
also
is
I
most
look
forward
to
come
to
one
of
the
city
but
because

economically
not
rich
or
because
I
was
in
the
city
without
known
relatives
so
only
stayed
in
the
countryside
most
lifetime
until
since
junior
high
school
lost

I
forced
to
quit

but
in

for
half
a
year
have
the
honor
to
the
D

lead
I
first
came
to
the
city
to
work
Since
D

hear
my
boring
at
home
after
the

he
was
in
the
very
next
day
morning
speeding
and
returned
to
his
hometown
urged
me
to
go
to
the
city
to
do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or
promises
probably
at
that
time
I
have
been
in
the
dream
of
the
life
in
the
city
there's
nothing
to
refuse
the
And
in
that
day
in
the
evening
mother

while
sewing

while
another

told
me
A
Cheng
You

your
cousin's
arrangement
don't
go
out
on
a
night
out
that
will
make
your
brother
worry
will
let
us
worry
there
is
the
question
of
your
life
must
be
well
orderly
and
you
wear
and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother
and
friends
will
look
down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said
you
know
now
but
really
to
the
city
after
you
is
it
right
Our
words
as
unheeded
advice
that
an
inlet
and
an
outlet
to
forget
about
and
do
I
hope
you
not
if
you
so
dad
wouldn't
want
to
control
you
The
night
his
father
for
the
first
time
to
drink
is
also
the
first
time
that
I
drank
tincture
MOET
drunk
I
in
the
night
imperceptibly
in
wheezing
to
sleep
Early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
I
also
in
outdoor
breathe
fresh
air
waiting
for
mother
made
breakfast
eat
a
good
meal
with
my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also
can
Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or
accept
it
D's
said
rest
assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her
I
will
give
him
his
money
saved
in
the
home
My
father
put
the
money
back
pocket
looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
that
here
was
the
last
miss
that
my
heart
is
full
of
hope
full
of
ideals
is
my
nostalgia
reminds
me
of
the
beauty
of
my
hometown
As
tears
like
springs
that
my
surging
mood
as
in
heaven
so
here
swear
resolutely
obey
D's
command
I
went
to
Lake
source
direction
to
horse
sword
shift
car
went
straight
to
the
F
town
Go
forward
with
great
strength
and
vigour
to
the
F
city
F
City
we
in
the
long-distance
passenger
station
of
the
car
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
city
I
think
it's
great
it
is
because
I
first
saw
the
perfect
city
probably
for
the
city
people
the
city
is
not
big
because
there
are
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
such
as
Shanghai
Hangzhou
Nanjing
are
so
But
I
look
I
see
it
is
because
I
have
no
contact
with
the
city
and
the
first
contact
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
novelty
I
felt
that
here
is
my
dream
of
heaven
D
s
first
got
out
of
the
car
I
have
to
get
off
the
streets
together
with
him
I
don't
know
what
this
is
what
Lane
Road
always
feel
in
the
alley
as
in
gossip
so
I
feel
I
can't
touch
the
North
East
and
touched
the
East
has
touched
the
north
deeply
he
was
puzzled
When
I
came
to
a
river
river
sides
erected
a
high-rise
blocks
I
always
thought
that
this
is
the
Fuchun
River
I
really
think
you
saw
the
Fuchun
River
I
was
a
sigh
and
said
the
Fuchun
River
does
not
have
such
a
river
I
didn't
necessarily
it
big
D's
said
this
is
not
the
Fuchun
River
but
an
amaranth
Pujiang
I
said
oh
It
is
my
illusion
Words
I
am
his
behind
but
when
we
are
at
the
crossroads
in
the
middle
turn
right
this
is
a
long
hill
road
Liuzhou
Road
building
is
bristly
and
let
me
feel
the
perfect
city
economy
is
thriving
and
prosperous
each
poineering
hardships
may
make
it
difficult
to
imagine
as
I
came
to
a
world
came
to
a
childhood
paradise
I
see
a
paradise
of
dream
in
my
nose
to
dazzle
along
the
road
of
hill
of
dragon
of
the
past
it
is
a
city
surrounded
by
people
in
and
out
of
the
mall
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
in
the
commercial
city
upstairs
to
write
the
Fuchun
River
commercial
city
it
seems
like
I
know
this
is
F
the
city's
most
bustling
shopping
center
the
most
bustling
sidewalks
I
just
want
to
say
the
city
of
F
F
really
great
I
came
to
this
strange
city
I
really
feel
in
this
strange
city
I
can
absorb
your
sunny
temperament
to
be
a
city
that
the
giants
I
am
going
to
show
themselves
When
I
didn't
see
enough
outside
downtown
scene
I
was
D's
to
the
commercial
city
there
are
all
the
stalls
food
stands
above
the
green
vegetables
eggplant
garlic
onion
bean
curd
a
kind
sister
church
where
D's
stall
led
me
here
and
sister
chatted
a
while
when
the
elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
is
to
eat
lunch
saw
us
big
brother
put
down
his
chopsticks
call
us
to
sit
down
then
O
O
said
A
Cheng
Your
dinner

you
had
dinner
yet
I
haven't
answered
D's
for
I
said
we
have
no
Big
brother
says
here
to
eat
not
home
to
burn
She
also
said
yes
Or
here
to
eat
even
home
to
burn
much
trouble
D's
said
not
so
polite
home
to
burn
it
it
didn't
take
long
very
fast
He
made
the
remarks
at
the
same
time
I
still
look
around
because
I
see
here
is
such
a
big
stall
is
also
the
first
time
saw
so
many
dishes
people
buy
vegetable
stall
So
my
curiosity
in
here
is
not
fun
When
I
put
the
spirit
are
concentrated
in
the
food
stalls
of
things
he
finished
on
the
go
I'm
still
hazy
a
bit
at
a
loss
situation
he
said
to
me
A
Cheng
we
go
I
didn't
hear
there
is
one
point
be
absent-minded
look
he
coaxed
out
of
said
hello
What's
on
your
mind
Told
you
so
loudly
did
not
hear
Go
I
said
oh
Elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
to
pick
some
fresh
vegetables
let
you
bring
us
back
to
cook
he
and
I
left
sister
they
couple
booth
then
to
another
butcher
shop
stall
bought
several
kilograms
of
meat
left
the
commercial
city
and
imperceptibly
and
through
a
Malaysian
Road
came
to
a
named
Zhou
Jianong
lane
across
the
alley
alley
went
to
D's
house
D's
house
is
an
underground
garage
inside
a
very
the
smell
is
also
important
I
very
want
to
move
out
but
I
will
not
economic
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
environment
here
it
is
the
parents
of
thousand
exhort
enjoin
let
I
firmly
remember
them
you
want
me
to
listen
to
D's
so
I
had
to
reluctantly
stay
When
I
walked
inside
the
heat
from
the
outside
directly
to
heaven
so
I
really
feel
it's
hard
I
am
afraid
went
into
the
furnace
of
the
house
let
me
really
angry
be
ashamed
of
dying
When
I
was
in
the
hot
sun
dried
by
the
sun
at
the
same
time
D's
said
why
don't
you
come
in
Quickly
Wash
dishes
I
went
to
go
say
to
him
it
is
too
hot
I
have
a
bit
of
a
bear
D's
continued
hot
A
fan
Do
not
be
afraid
of
heat
a
long
time
to
get
over
I
come
too
but
we
insist
on
the
stand
A
man
should
be
afraid
of
tired
we
are
so
out
of
practice
I
said
oh
Came
to
give
him
food
finished
lunch
he's
out
let
me
have
a
rest
at
home
for
a
day
starting
tomorrow
I
promised
D's
a
boring
also
have
a
look
at
the
room
television
occasionally
to
bring
home
the
story
books
doubled
the
old
warm
up
in
primary
and
secondary
schools
the
residual
reading
difficulty
One
day
in
the
imperceptibly
in
the
past
soon
arrived
at
dusk
D's
also
returned
to
cook
I
don't
know
how
to
cook
so
there
are
a
lot
of
housework
is
D's
one
person
to
complete
I
can
only
one
wash
dishes
clean
the
room
health
or
what
other
are
not
good
At
night
after
dinner
D's
and
I
had
to
watch
TV
in
bed
TV
also
is
no
good
program
I
watched
a
imperceptibly
fell
asleep
Suddenly
I
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
I
will
readily
but
here
I
can
not
find
the
toilet
was
anxious
to
panic
I
find
that
I
finally
find
convenient
corner
when
I
finished
returned
was
a
patrol
car
through
here
I
was
found
by
police
as
a
thief
was
caught
The
car
out
of
the
two
patrol
to
check
my
ID
card
I
came
to
the
interior
from
my
bag
show
identity
cards
to
give
them
they
took
out
the
register
put
my
name
and
identity
card
number
is
recorded
in
it
and
again
and
again
I
ask
my
family
and
address
then
they
contact
D
s
asked
his
identity
asked
his
work
address
information
is
very
detailed
and
they
have
put
D
s
identity
as
a
pledge
export
to
a
television
set
let
him
leave
the
TV
invoice
and
specifications
to
verify
can
put
his
things
he
returned
to
the
He
had
to
accept
to
let
them
D's
until
the
patrol
had
gone
he
said
how
can
you
not
carefully
let
the
guard
discovered
I
said
I
don't
know
How
do
I
know
the
night
police
so
fiercely
knew
that
I
wouldn't
back
out
D's
continued
next
to
a
sharp
point
don't
be
so
idiotic
Know
or
not
Said
oh
Know
Put
out
the
light
then
we
sleep
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
sleep
at
night
because
the
room
was
at
night
is
also
very
difficult
to
eliminate
unless
the
outside
temperature
drops
to
the
upper
20s
degrees
after
midnight
there
may
be
more
comfortable
Wake
up
the
first
thing
I
do
is
to
wash
brush
work
then
I
put
a
few
of
the
ash
bucket
and
a
large
shovels
and
in
D
s
back
leading
me
to
play
first
In
fact
I
don't
know
what
is
hard
what
is
helpless
life
I
have
not
try
at
home
parents
regard
me
as
a
saint
as
for
at
that
time
I
feel
so
blessed
and
now
I
can
only
obey
D's
leadership
as
his
apprentice
I
came
to
the
city
gates
then
turn
to
the
Old
Road
South
Gate
Street
South
Gate
Street
rely
on
the
Fuchun
River
and
that
a
large
river
it
is
the
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
we
stand
position
is
the
Fuchun
River
ferry
terminal
just
because
it
is
against
the
direction
of
the
city
to
the
South
so
it
means
draw
road
also
known
as
South
Gate
Street
near
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
I
came
here
did
not
look
at
the
moon
not
here
on
vacation
trip
or
something
I

This
is

I

to
do
it
My
first
day
at
work
is
to
carry
cement

or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too

I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want

work
on
the
path
of
two

in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a

be
petrified

How

I
not

Seems
to
me
the

if
more
magnificent
rhetoric
Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk
the

Beat
the

Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me

I
learned
to
language
in
the
river
The
first
word-mom
How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only
for

Breeze
send
me
to

But
regardless
of
the

climb
sweat
poured
Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite
write
of

Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
and
vertical
dignified
and
imposing
You
said
that
a
man
have
to
like
it
Young
i
was
not
sensible
Occasionally
make
a
mistake
You
taught
me
the
force
of
justice
I
keep
in
mind
your
word
Dare
not
have
a
bit
slight
In
order
to
build
a
quiet
environment
for
my
studies
The
already
heavy
burden
of
the
family
You
take
on
all
the
housework
and
farm
work
Even
if
was
too
tired
to
take
a
breath
Also
won't
let
me
take
part
in
I
was
moved
to
nothing
to

In
my
memory
You've
never

You

What
is

On

You

And

All

Only

a
good

And

been
that

I
started
back
to
have
a
look
their
growth

one
every
day
watching
I
alone
posture
standing
on
the
roadside
inserted
his

in

I
see
countless
people
from
my
side

by
they
came
on
with
the
coffee
holding
a
drink
take
the
textbook
with

They
be
in
a
hurry
to
depart
put
me
off
like
an
idle
about
Occasionally
someone
stopped

at
me
I
know

Guo
Jingming
said
my
friends
are
my
courage
to
live
and
they
give
me
your
ability
let
me
face
this
world
no
longer
panic
Those
who
have
and
be
crazy
with
me
with
sadness
with
cycling
through
the
thin
youth
friend
I
think
we
all
remember
the
youth
is
how
we
face
cannot
erase
the
traces
Xiao

Hainan
in

Whenever
we

her
phone
call
she
received
the
text
message
she
always
likes
to
write
very
long
As
it
was
she
knew
I
was
a
very
insecure
afraid
to
lose
even
if
there
is
no
important
will
also
write
a
long
message
let
me
know
her
by
my
side
never
leave
Chen
is
a
very
clever
girl
but
in
the
study
does
not
enlighten
after
each
test
there
will
always
be
that

my

a
begged
me
to
help
her
with
We
have
been
together
for
9
years
so
only
a
piece
of
memory
I
always
thought
she
was
a
bright
child
happy
and
simple
life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
From
the
bright
sunlight
If
the
rain
from
the
cloud
Break
your
pride
Think
of
my
love
for
you
And
everything
shall
be
fine
Let
us
soar
let
us
fly
To
the
highest
height
And
everything
shall
be
fineLast
year
the
cancer
nearly
finished
me
off
However
with
the
accompaniment
of
my
best
friend
Candice
I
could
eventually
get
through
these
tough
time
Sometimes
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
always
stand
by
my
side
Last
summer
the
doctor
discovered
that
I
suffered
from
lung
cancer
At
that
moment
I
was
completely
shocked
All
memories
that
I
have
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
in
seconds
I
thought
I
was
going
to
leave
all
my
friends
my
family
and
all
people
I
loved
To
me
the
whole
world
was
just
sinking
Luckily
that
was
just
in
an
early
stage
and
the
doctor
said
that
I
had
I
great
chance
to
recover
after
a
series
of
treatments
But
he
warned
me
that
the
treatment
would
be
very
tough
and
painful
At
first
I
have
considered
to
refuse
the
treatment
However
after
I
have
though
about
all
of
my
valuable
friends
and
my
mom
and
dad
I
chose
to
take
the
chance
During
the
treatment
I
gradually
suffered
from
the
side
effects
The
number
of
hairs
on
my
head
declined
and
I
vomited
from
dawn
till
night
on
every
single
day
I
had
a
very
poor
appetite
and
I
nearly
had
no
desired
to
put
any
food
to
my
mouth
I
was
very
painful
and
I
was
thinking
about
giving
up
the
treatment
I
though
I
could
not
tolerate
it
anymore
However
with
the
support
and
encouragement
from
my
best
friend
Candice
I
have
eventually
made
it
through
the
rain
and
stand
up
once
again
Finally
I
recovered
One
summer
night
Candice
came
to
the
hospital
to
visit
me
We
sat
on
the
bench
that
facing
the
sea
The
sun
was
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
night
descended
We
chatted
underneath
the
stars
We
have
not
met
each
other
since
the
graduation
Candice
said
with
tears
on
her
face
Yes
I
have
never
thought
we
would
have
the
reunion
in
the
situation
I
said
She
kept
silent
with
her
tears
in
the
warm
gentle
breeze
We
have
been
best
friends
since
we
were
small
I
do
not
want
this
friendship
to
end
up
so
soon
She
cried
desperately
Zach
you
are
a
man
You
are
a
man
who
is
courageous
and
adventurous
You
should
have
that
guts
to
fight
for
your
life
and
people
around
you
But
Now
I
am
going
to
give
you
the
courage
you
need
She
lay
her
hand
on
me
Lord
please
give
this
little
boy
love
and
hope
to
face
the
obstacle
that
he
is
now
facing
Please
give
him
courage
to
help
him
to
find
the
way
Now
you
have
already
possessed
the
ability
to
fight
this
war
You
should
never
give
up
as
there
is
a
light
in
your
heart
and
shines
very
brightly
Since
them
I
understand
that
when
fate
is
tough
just
toughen
your
faith
With
a
smile
I
know
I
could
face
the
future
no
matter
what
lay
ahead
And
there's
a
hero
comes
along
with
the
strength
to
carry
on
My
dad
has
always
used
this
song
to
encourage
me
Until
he
passed
away
I
still
keep
this
song
in
my
iPod
and
listen
to
it
when
I
need
to
get
through
some
tough
time
To
me
this
song
does
not
only
symbolize
the
spirit
of
my
dad
but
also
mine
This
song
is
ubiquitous
in
various
singing
competitions
Regardless
of
its
singing
technique
the
beautiful
melody
and
those
meaningful
lyrics
has
helped
many
people
to
get
through
obstacles
This
fabulous
song
was
composed
by
American
singer-songwriter
Mariah
Carey
in
1993
and
definitely
performed
by
herself
The
song
mentioned
that
among
every
single
one
of
us
a
hero
lies
inside
our
heart
If
we
try
to
reach
into
our
soul
our
emptiness
will
disappear
There's
a
hero
if
you
look
inside
your
heart
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid
of
who
you
are
When
I
was
small
I
was
a
child
who
was
so
fragile
and
cried
easily
I
was
afraid
of
everything
I
was
so
this
and
small
and
when
my
classmates
bullied
me
all
I
would
do
was
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
and
cry
from
dawn
till
night
Worse
still
I
was
poor
in
academic
result
and
no
teachers
loved
me
On
these
days
I
found
myself
useless
and
believed
that
no
one
in
this
world
would
recognise
this
small
potato
I
was
so
desperate
Yet
in
one
dark
night
my
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
hand
was
so
large
and
warm
All
I
could
feel
was
the
love
and
hope
transmitted
through
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
and
to
my
heart
and
soul
Son
you
should
not
be
fragile
anymore
But
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
Now
I
am
going
to
recall
your
hero
from
your
soul
and
from
now
on
you
would
never
feel
lonely
anymore
My
hero
and
your
hero
have
already
stayed
together
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
Other
people
can
say
anything
they
want
to
say
Although
they
try
to
bring
you
down
you
will
never
allow
them
to
do
so
because
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
This
hero
will
always
stay
close
to
you
and
protect
you
forever
Afterwards
he
sang
this
song
to
me
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow
But
don't
let
anyone
to
tear
them
away
Since
then
whenever
I
need
to
face
any
problems
or
obstacles
alone
I
will
not
be
fragile
anymore
All
I
need
to
do
is
sing
Hero
along
with
my
hero
and
my
father's
hero
and
I
will
certainly
know
that
my
father
will
guide
me
where
I
should
go
I
know
that
there
is
a
light
in
me
and
shines
very
brightly
and
other
people
can
try
but
they
can
never
take
that
away
from
me
The
meeting
is
WangHai
Time
always
unknowingly
hurried
away
flash
Also
in
the
online
to
spend
a
few
years
Cry
also
laughed
Thousands
of
day
and
night
WangHai
roaming
A
thought
to
mature
Walk
to
the
friend
go
to
How
many
friends
already
not
disappear
Sitting
alone
in
the

campus

be
embarrassed
in
front
of
your
friends
When

anyone
You

her
by
saying
It's
none

your
business
When
you
were

she
suggested
certain
careers
for

future
You

like
you
When

she
could

a

When
you

she

Muuhh-ther

deeply
she
loved
you
You
thanked
her
by
moving
halfway
across
the
country
When
you
were

the
baby

now

you
of
a
relative's

really
busy
right
now
When

she
fell
ill
and
needed
you
to
take
care
of
her
You
thanked
her
by
reading
about
the
burden
parents
become
to
their
children
And
then
one
day
she
quietly
died
And
everything
you
never
did
came
crashing
down
like
thunder
Rock
me
baby
rock
me
all
night
long
The
hand
who
rocks
the
cradle...may
rock
the
world
Let
us
take
a
moment
of
the
time
just
to
pay
tribute
and
show
appreciation
to
the
person
called
mom
though
some
may
not
say
it
openly
to
their
mother
There's
no
substitute
for
her
Cherish
every
single
moment
Though
at
times
she
may
not
be
the
best
of
friends
may
not
agree
to
our
thoughts
she
is
still
your
mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left
Thomas
Carlyle
lived
from
1795
until
1881
He
was
a
10000
wow
gold
Scot
essayist
and
historian
During
his
lifetime
he
became
one
of
the
world's
greatest
writers
But
he
was
a
human
and
storage

On
October

1826
wow

Carlyle
married
his
secretary
Jane
Welsh
She
was
an
intelligent
attractive
and
somewhat
temperamental
daughter
of
a
well-to-do
doctor
They
had
their
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
but
still
loved
Bathroom
Vanities
each
other
dearly
After
their
marriage
Jane
continued
to
serve
as
his
secretary
But
after
several
years
of
marriage
Jane
became
ill
Being
Bathroom
Mirrors
a
hard
worker
Carlyle
became
so
absorbed
in
his
writings
that
he
let
Jane
continue
working
for
several
weeks
after
she
became
ill
She
had
cancer
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
slow
growing
kind
she
finally
became
confined
to
her
bed
Although
Carlyle
loved
her
Bathroom
Accessories
dearly
he
very
seldom
found
time
to
stay
with
her
long
He
was
busy
with
his
work
when
Jane
died
they
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
for
the
service
The
day
Glass
Basin
was
a
miserable
day
It
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
Following
the
funeral
Carlyle
went
back
to
his
home
He
was
taking
it
pretty
hard
He
went
up
the
stairs
to
Jane's
room
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
her
bed
He
sat
there
thinking
Shower
Enclosures
about
how
little
time
he
had
spent
with
her
and
wishing
so
much
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
differently
Noticing
her
diary
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
picked
it
up
and
began
to
steel
shelving
read
it
Suddenly
he
seemed
shocked
He
saw
it
There
on
one
page
she
had
written
Interior
Doors
a
single
line
Yesterday
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
and
it
was
like
heaven
I
love
him
so
Something
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
He
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
that
he
meant
so
much
to
her
He
thought
of
all
wow
gold
australia
the
times
he
had
gone
about
his
work
without
thinking
about
and
noticing
her
Then
Carlyle
turned
the
page
in
the
diary
There
he
noticed
she
racking
had
written
some
words
that
broke
his
heart
I
have
listened
all
day
to
hear
his
steps
in
the
hall
but
now
it
is
late
and
I
guess
he
won't
come
today
Carlyle
read
a
little
more
in
the
book
Then
he
threw
it
down
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Some
of
his
friends
found
him
at
the
grave
his
buy
wow
gold
australia
face
buried
in
the
mud
His
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
Tears
continued
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
He
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
If
I
had
only
known
if
I
had
only
known
But
it
was
too
late
for
Carlyle
She
was
dead
After
Jane's
death
Carlyle
made
world
of
warcraft
gold
for
sale
little
attempt
to
write
again
The
historians
say
he
lived
another
15
years
weary
bored
and
a
partial
recluse
I
share
the
story
with
in
the
hope
that
you
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
While
our
loved
ones
must
have
the
money
we
make
to
live
it
is
the
love
we
have
that
they
really
want
Give
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
It
is
not
easy
to
define
what
kind
of
meaning
to
the
enterprise
culture
because
the
enterpise
culture
stems
from
the
ration
and
reality
which
should
be
related
to
the
regulations
or
how
to
react
to
the
risk
of
management
or
market
instead
of
just
focusing
on
training
and
meeting
which
should
be
related
to
the
proportion
of
thoughts
of
belonging
to
our
company
and
benefitting
our
company
in
the
difficulty
Sometimes
the
puzzled
people
are
always
in
the
mess
of
understanding
of
why
the
itemized
regulations
could
not
optimize
the
operation
and
not
regulate
the
action
of
some
officials
who
always
abused
the
power
to
benefit
themselves
which
lead
to
the
argument
that
as
long
as
the
company
is
so
large
that
the
culture
of
enterprise
is
absolutly
difficult
to
be
built
up
Different
people
with
different
education
background
and
different
comprehension
of
society
would
not
be
integrated
to
the
common
recognition
of
enterprise
culture
which
is
the
crux
to
help
the
company
be
prosperous
In
spite
of
training
many
officials
there
are
lots
of
bottlenecks
which
should
be
smoothed
and
holes
which
should
be
covered
so
we
must
work
out
some
measures
to
make
our
company
step
on
the
right
road
Regulations
are
parts
of
the
enterprise
culture
making
the
road
straight
but
what
kind
of
regulations
are
suitful
to
the
state-owned
company
The
regulation
are
always
eroded
by
dereliction
and
are
not
always
strickly
implemented
by
some
departments
Frankly
speaking
the
enterprise
culture
is
just
having
some
aspects
in
consciousness
frequently
dominating
the
behavior
which
would
give
us
some
reference
on
how
to
enact
the
detailed
regulations
could
get
the
return
as
expected
The
most
important
thing
related
to
the
enterprise
culture
is
how
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
in
the
every
respect
of
operation
We
must
detail
every
process
of
how
to
control
the
cost
and
how
to
make
the
work
efficient
and
rational
If
employee
could
make
their
regulations
rooted
in
mind
they
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
keep
them
from
dereliction
and
would
try
their
best
to
devote
the
wisdom
to
benifitting
our
company.For
example
The
flaws
in
human
nature
and
the
shortage
of
wealth
would
seduce
the
officals
to
accept
the
secret
money
from
agencies
who
are
intended
to
pull
down
the
officals
by
all
kinds
of
tactics
and
if
the
officals
are
too
fragile
to
resist
the
gifts
they
would
be
united
with
agencies
to
cheat
our
company
so
the
task
which
brooks
no
delay
is
the
education
brainwashing
and
making
the
severe
punishment
happen
without
them
the
enterprise
culture
is
like
the
moon
in
water
like
the
flowers
in
mist
like
the
stupid
being
called
clever
What
is
the
quintessence
of
the
enterprise
culture
It
is
easy
or
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
conclusion
because
it
is
a
hard
job
to
change
people¡¯s
mindset
which
is
always
in
the
prejustice.So
at
first
we
must
scrutinize
the
origin
of
the
prejustice
why
are
so
many
people
always
just
negating
others
because
we
are
extremely
lack
of
communication
to
understand
with
each
other
lacking
of
wisdom
to
tell
the
right
and
the
wrong
lacking
of
the
wide
chest
to
tolerate
the
different
ideas
wnich
lead
to
misunderstand
among
people
and
to
form
the
impasse
to
flexibly
resolve
the
thorny
problem.There
are
some
words
similar
and
implicated
with
the
word
culture
in
dictionary
such
as
communication
concoct
cooperation
coordination
copartner
control¡±
giving
us
some
metaphor
or
euphemism
that
enterprise
culture
must
depend
on
the
communication
cooperation
must
control
the
ridiculous
behavior
of
some
officials
must
concoct
the
atmosphere
from
stiff
suffocated
environment
to
the
active
creative
philosophical
philanthropic
state
of
mindset
of
everyone.But
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
behavior
spontaneously
follow
the
bright
side
of
human
being
just
because
of
the
fragile
and
selfish
nature
of
people
with
some
ignorant
knowledge
about
themselves
so
using
the
regulations
to
control
the
devil
in
their
mindset
and
encouraging
the
bold
attitude
to
resolve
the
present
and
history
problem
is
the
essential
way
of
making
the
enterprise
culture
alive
and
giving
the
light
to
the
employee
We
must
change
the
thoughts
that
we
are
isolated
by
others
we
are
just
living
for
ourself
we
are
just
focusing
on
our
private
cases
to
the
thoughts
that
if
we
can
help
each
other
if
we
believe
in
the
philosophy
of
strengthenning
the
consciousness
of
doing
the
job
positively
and
wisely
getting
good
return
we
can
achieve
the
goal
of
making
our
company
profitful
and
competitive
even
making
our
life
happy
Why
are
the
employee
always
having
no
enthusiasm
and
lacking
of
a
little
responsibility
in
their
job?why
are
there
lots
of
complaint
in
our
company?why
are
the
talented
people
resigning
quickly
from
our
company?Yes
the
salary
is
the
key
and
having
no
feeling
in
cooperation
unity
belonging
and
having
not
the
promising
future
are
the
fundamental
reasons
which
steamrollerred
the
spirit
to
be
loyal
to
company
so
putting
the
importance
of
employee
in
priority
is
the
way
of
having
the
high
competition
in
this
globallized
world
A
healthy
company
is
the
one
that
urgently
need
the
creative
advices
from
employee
in
stead
of
closing
their
eyes
filling
in
their
ears
in
front
of
the
employee
who
may
have
some
profound
and
pragmatic
ideas
which
maybe
benifit
to
the
operation
of
our
company.But
how
to
distinguish
the
good
ideas
or
the
wrong
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
leaders
who
must
look
through
everything
including
themselves
and
others
adding
that
they
must
comprehend
the
logic
of
mindset
and
behavior
of
themself
To
be
leaders
the
open
attitude
is
the
good
way
to
rationalize
the
management
adopting
the
positive
way
to
eliminate
the
flaws
in
the
structure
and
to
attain
the
goal
with
attacking
the
black
hands¡±
instead
of
always
being
in
defensive
measure
of
healing
the
fissure
in
management
that
is
deficient
in
courage
and
wisdom.It
is
also
one
part
of
the
enterprise
culture.Frankly
saying
having
good
return
to
our
company
is
dominated
by
the
fate
by
the
hearts
of
all
employee
by
the
regulations
by
the
rational
philosophy
by
the
authentic
wisdom
Service
is
the
culture
it
sounds
like
simple
but
complicated
and
profound
if
you
want
to
make
it
better
and
better
How
to
do
service
is
the
important
culture
of
enterprise
which
could
attract
many
people
to
take
our
flights
again
and
again.We
can
ask
a
simple
question
that
if
you
look
up
to
see
the
twinkled
stars
in
night
what
make
you
comfortable?The
answer
is
easy
the
bright
the
color
make
you
feel
comfortable
which
can
make
us
have
some
comprehension
that
if
you
make
people¡¯s
body
such
as
eye
ear
limbs
nose
heart
feel
nice
your
service
is
the
nice
service
if
you
make
the
customers
angry
you
failed
in
doing
service.So
you
must
think
over
how
to
make
the
customers
feel
better
is
the
best
way
to
learn
how
to
give
service
to
these
arrogant
and
hypercritical
customers
Above
all
We
can
understand
that
if
you
have
regulations
in
your
mindset
which
sometimes
is
selfish
and
Out
of
my
window
the
darkness
gave
me
a
signal:if
you
are
habitted
in
the
darkness
of
heart
you
would
be
dissappionted
for
ever.sometimes
I
want
to
find
the
way
of
making
me
in
the
positive
attitude
to
the
life
but
always
are
beated
by
my
experiences
which
cutted
off
the
robe
attached
to
the
sunshine.but
the
frustrated
happenning
is
not
the
domination
which
converts
my
good
intention
to
the
devil
the
domination
is
my
thoughts
which
are
sometimes
not
superficial
but
profound
gives
me
the
light
and
warm
to
live
simply
and
happily
What
kind
of
thoughts
would
release
my
pressure
and
gives
me
the
ability
to
survive
in
the
chilly
and
choppy
reality
which
would
distort
the
heart
fragile
to
the
fragmentary
condition
or
make
the
heart
wisom
strong
get
the
meaning
of
life
which
would
push
me
to
the
heaven
with
lots
of
beauty
and
full
I
would
say
that
my
thoughts
is
related
to
the
thoughts
themselves
if
you
can
change
the
thoughts
quickly
and
correctedly
you
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
pusure
the
objects
you
want;if
you
are
stubborn
enough
you
would
be
easily
defeated
by
the
fate
which
urgently
need
the
wisdom
light
to
cover
the
black
in
the
mindset
full
of
good
and
evil
When
I
was
a
child
I
do
not
know
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
and
have
no
faith
which
would
comfort
my
soul
to
give
me
a
light
would
direct
my
road
to
the
tranquillized
home
My
pressure
is
from
my
family
where
my
father
is
not
a
reasonable
person
and
had
no
ideas
on
how
to
cultivate
my
individual
personality
and
my
character
so
in
the
long
time
I
felt
the
life
of
mine
is
in
hell
even
if
I
have
food
to
eat
have
cloth
to
wear
but
my
heart
was
in
deep
frustration
and
had
much
hatre
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
shaping
my
thoughts
that
the
life
had
not
power
to
lift
me
from
the
miserable
conditions.after
long
long
time
the
climate
has
been
changed
to
more
warm
the
rivers
have
been
changed
to
more
polluted
the
hearts
of
many
people
have
been
changed
by
desire
for
money
to
be
vicious
my
god
has
given
me
the
enlight
that
if
you
can
comprehend
the
love
the
truth
you
can
have
sheft
below
the
sunshine
which
would
fill
you
and
warm
you
so
it
is
my
fortunation
I
can
get
the
hints
from
god
giving
me
the
truth
which
fattened
my
twisted
raods
in
the
mist
and
I
can
smile
happily
and
never
be
frustrated
again
Even
if
I
explain
the
understanding
of
love
and
truth
again
and
again
lots
of
people
still
had
lof
of
question
on
my
comprehension
about
the
thoughts
as
same
as
my
past.in
my
past
I
was
puzzled
intensifiedly
on
some
meaningful
words.some
people
said
to
me
the
words
wisdom
but
it
is
like
a
fool
who
can
not
distinguish
what
is
right
or
wrong
I
am
delayed
to
understand
the
truth
which
stumbled
my
existence
and
made
me
fall
to
hell.but
the
darkness
is
not
always
having
no
light
maybe
my
god
has
pity
on
me
one
day
I
found
thoughts
can
change
my
action
my
attitude
to
the
life
I
confronted
that
is
in
the
embarrassed
condition.after
I
have
been
changed
to
the
peace
life
by
the
fresh
way
of
thinking
I
can
in
confidence
make
a
conclusion
that
please
believing
in
the
god¡¯s
soul
that
tell
you
what
is
yours
what
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
this
world
worthy
pusuring
you
should
love
should
dent
the
suffering
you
have
got
and
smiling
in
the
darkness
stubborn
and
everyone
would
follow
the
regulations
rooted
in
your
heart
thinking
of
the
company
as
your
own
our
enterprise
would
be
promising.The
safety
and
service
is
the
crux
to
our
enterprise
we
must
strengthen
our
consciousness
to
keep
them
in
our
mind
and
do
our
best
to
support
it
VIRTUE
is
like
a
rich
stone
best
plain
set
and
surely
virtue
is
best
in
a
body
that
is
comely
though
not
of
delicate
features
and
that
hath
rather
dignity
of
presence
than
beauty
of
aspect
Neither
is
it
almost
seen
that
very
beautiful
persons
are
otherwise
of
great
virtue
as
if
nature
were
rather
busy
not
to
err
than
in
labor
to
produce
excellency
And
therefore
they
prove
accomplished
but
not
of
great
spirit
and
study
rather
behavior
than
virtue
But
this
holds
not
always
for
Augustus
Caesar
Titus
Vespasianus
Philip
le
Belle
of
France
Edward
the
Fourth
of
England
Alcibiades
of
Athens
Ismael
the
Sophy
of
Persia
were
all
high
and
great
spirits
and
yet
the
most
beautiful
men
of
their
times
In
beauty
that
of
favor
is
more
than
that
of
color
and
that
of
decent
and
gracious
motion
more
than
that
of
favor
That
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
cannot
express
no
nor
the
first
sight
of
the
life
There
is
no
excellent
beauty
that
hath
not
some
strangeness
in
the
proportion
A
man
cannot
tell
whether
Apelles
or
Albert
Durer
were
the
more
trifler
whereof
the
one
would
make
a
personage
by
geometrical
proportions
the
other
by
taking
the
best
parts
out
of
divers
faces
to
make
one
excellent
Such
personages
I
think
would
please
nobody
but
the
painter
that
made
them
Not
but
I
think
a
painter
may
make
a
better
face
than
ever
was
but
he
must
do
it
by
a
kind
of
felicity
as
a
musician
that
maketh
an
excellent
air
in
music
and
not
by
rule
A
man
shall
see
faces
that
if
you
examine
them
part
by
part
you
shall
find
never
a
good
and
yet
altogether
do
well
If
it
be
true
that
the
principal
part
of
beauty
is
in
decent
motion
certainly
it
is
no
marvel
though
persons
in
years
seem
many
times
more
amiable
pulchrorum
autumnus
pulcher
for
no
youth
can
be
comely
but
by
pardon
and
considering
the
youth
as
to
make
up
the
comeliness
Beauty
is
as
summer
fruits
which
are
easy
to
corrupt
and
cannot
last
and
for
the
most
part
it
makes
a
dissolute
youth
and
an
age
a
little
out
of
countenance
but
yet
certainly
again
if
it
light
well
it
maketh
virtue
shine
and
vices
blush
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
It
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is

running

to
the

father
to
shake

again
and
again
until
it
was
firm
enough
As
time
passed
there
were
other
rules
to
learn
Always
do
your
best.""Do
it
now.""Never
lie
And
most
importantly
"You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
By
my
teens
he
wasn't
telling
me
what
to
do
anymore
which
was
scary
and
heady
at
the
same
time
He
provided
perspective
not
telling
me
what
was
around
the
great
corner
of
life
but
letting
me
know
there
was
a
lot
more
than
just
today
and
the
next
which
I
hadn't
thought
of
One
day
I
realize
now
there
was
a
change
I
wasn't
trying
to
please
him
so
much
as
I
was
trying
to
impress
him
I
never
asked
him
to
come
to
my
football
games
He
had
a
high-pressure
career
and
it
meant
driving
through
most
of
Friday
night
But
for
all
the
big
games
when
I
looked
over
at
the
sideline
there
was
that
familiar
fedora
And
by
God
did
the
opposing
team
captain
ever
get
a
firm
handshake
and
a
gaze
he
would
remember
Then
a
school
fact
contradicted
something
he
said
Impossible
that
he
could
be
wrong
but
there
it
was
in
the
book
These
accumulated
over
time
along
with
personal
experiences
to
buttress
my
own
developing
sense
of
values
And
I
could
tell
we
had
each
taken
our
own
perfectly
normal
paths
I
began
to
see
too
his
blind
spots
his
prejudices
and
his
weaknesses
I
never
threw
these
up
at
him
He
hadn't
to
me
and
anyway
he
seemed
to
need
protection
I
stopped
asking
his
advice
the
experiences
he
drew
from
no
longer
seemed
relevant
to
the
decisions
I
had
to
make
He
volunteered
advice
for
a
while
But
then
in
more
recent
years
politics
and
issues
gave
way
to
talk
of
empty
errands
and
always
to
ailments
From
his
bed
he
showed
me
the
many
sores
and
scars
on
his
misshapen
body
and
all
the
bottles
for
medicine
Sometimes
he
confided
I
would
just
like
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
not
wake
up
After
much
thought
and
practice
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
one
night
last
winter
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
and
remembered
for
an
instant
those
terrifying
dark
holes
in
another
house
35
years
before
I
told
my
fatherhow
much
I
loved
him
I
described
all
the
things
people
were
doing
for
him
But
I
said
he
kept
eating
poorly
hiding
in
his
room
and
violating
the
doctor's
orders
No
amount
of
love
could
make
someone
else
care
about
life
I
said
it
was
a
two-way
street
He
wasn't
doing
his
best
The
decision
was
his
He
said
he
knew
how
hard
my
words
had
been
to
say
and
how
proud
he
was
of
me
I
had
the
best
teacher
I
said
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
He
smiled
a
little
And
we
shook
hands
firmly
for
the
last
time
Several
days
later
at
about
4
A.M
my
mother
heard
Dad
shuffling
about
their
dark
room
I
have
some
things
I
have
to
do
he
said
He
paid
a
bundle
of
bills
He
composed
for
my
mother
a
long
list
of
legal
and
financial
what-to-do's
in
case
of
emergency
And
he
wrote
me
a
note
Then
he
walked
back
to
his
bed
and
laid
himself
down
He
went
to
sleep
naturally
And
he
did
not
wake
up
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial
Party
committees
have
created
detailed
policies
to
improve
their
working
style
as
required
by
the
country's
core
leadership
With
these
measures
Party
authorities
are
attempting
to
get
closer
to
the
public

MOSCOW
Dec
26
Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans
on
U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against
Russians
abroad
and
persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take
effect
on
Jan
1
2013
if
signed
by
the

Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov
told

Wednesday
that
Putin
would
consider
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
within
two
weeks
after
the
Federation
Council
approved
it

house
of
the
parliament
on

passed
the
bill
with
420

supported
by
all
the
Russians
On
Wednesday
the
Moscow
police
have
detained
four
people
near
the
Federation
Council
building
who
were
protesting
against
the
bill
Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
in
November
1989
All
member
states
are
obliged
to

in
the
light
of
the
best
interests
of
a

Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the

area
of
land
as
is
used
Users
shall
be
responsible
for
reclaiming
the

Administration
Law
stipulates
Wang
Yunkun
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of
compensated
land
and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State
Council
or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens
or
hundreds
of
years
he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures
from

nearly

this

researchers
estimated
on

They
added
that
large
B2C
platforms
such
as
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
are
set
to
strengthen
their
lead
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
have
gradually
become
the
driving
force
of
the
nation's
e-commerce
industry
replacing
the
customer-to-customer
model
represented

said
Chen

an

Analysys
International
Turnover
in
the
country's
B2C
e-commerce
sector
is
projected
to
reach
470
billion
yuan
in
2012
a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the
market
in
the
years
to
come
said
Chen
The
report
did
not
say
how
much
market
share
the
nation's
top
B2C
players
are
going
to
take
in
2013
In
November
Tmall
and
Jingdong
Mall
accounted
for
more
than
70
percent
of
visits
to
Web
pages
in
the
B2C
sector
according
to
data
from
Huihui.cn
an
e-commerce
data
analysis
website
under
NetEase
Inc
Top
brick-and-mortar
chain
store
operators
such
as
Suning
Appliance
Co
Ltd
and
Gome
Electrical

also
joined
the

frenzy
said
the

Although
their
market
share
remains
small
compared
to
Tmall

Jingdong

the
traditional

online
operations
will
be
able
to
challenge

leaders
in

long

it
said
In
addition
the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's
e-commerce
industry
is
set
to
decline
in
the
coming
years
partly
because
retailers
will
find
it
is
harder
to
attract
new
customers
Jingdong

pledged
to
explore
new

based
on

in

Mandela
has
a
history
of
lung
problems
dating
back
to
when
he
contracted
tuberculosis
while
in

as
a
political
prisoner
He
spent
27
years
in
prison
including
18
years
on
the
windswept
Robben
Island
off
Cape
Town
The
former
president
was
admitted
to
a
Pretoria
hospital
on
December
8
and
this
was
his
longest
stay
in
hospital
since
he
was
released
from
prison
in
1990
Current

visited
Mandela
on
Christmas
Day
and
said
the
former
South
African
leader
was
doing
much
better
making
progress
and
in
good
spirits
Mandela
was
also
admitted
to
hospital
in
February
because
of
abdominal
pain
but
released
the
following
day
after
a
keyhole
examination
showed
there
was
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
him
He
has
spent
most
of
his
time
since
then
in
another
home
in
Qunu
his
ancestral
village
in
the
impoverished
Eastern
Cape
province
His
poor
health
has
prevented
him
from
making
any
public
appearances
in
the
past
two
years
although
he
has
continued
to
receive
high-profile
visitors

Mandela
became
South
Africa's
first
black
president
after
the
country's
first
all-race
elections
in

After
his
release
from

he
used
his
popularity
to
push
for
reconciliation
between
whites
and
blacks
which
became
the
bedrock
of

Mandela
stepped
down
as

in

after
one
term
in
office
and
has
largely
been
absent
from

A
religious
scholar
and
Shari¡®a
law
official
in
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
leadership
in
the
Aleppo
area
the
35-year-old
had
a
ready
answer
for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We
know
the
West
and
its
oppressive
ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N
Security
Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity
Smokers
need
not
apply
A
potential
recruit
must
undertake
a
10-day
religious-training
course
to
ascertain
his
understanding
of
religion
his
morals
his
reputation
A
15-to-20-day
military-training
program
follows
That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
the
vehicle
including
Abu
Adnan
who
silently
approached
the
car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not
introduce
himself
until
I
asked
who
he
was
later
We
drove
to
a
small
cold
concrete
room
with
a
tiny
window
that
barely
let
in
any
light
from
an
already
overcast
sky
We
sat
among
boxes
of
long-life
milk
and
bags
of
blankets
and
winter
clothes
waiting
to
be
distributed
Our
host
the
driver
tried
to
start
a
portable
gas
heater
but
there
was
no
gas
America
has
called
us
terrorists
because
it
says
that
some
of
our
tactics
bear
the
fingerprints
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de

of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan

are

Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat

A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late

leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in

before
the
revolution

Dressed

Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
to
bakeries
We
are
keeping
the
price
of
bread
at
15
lira
about
21
U.S
cents
which
was
its
true
price
Abu
Adnan
said
adding
that
transgressors
would
be
punished
according
to
Shari¡®a
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
also
thus
far
avoided
indiscriminate
civilian
casualties
That¡¯s
not
to
say
that
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
have
fierce
critics
especially
within
rebel
circles
In
addition
to
its
civilian
detractors
many
more
secular-minded
fighters
are
wary
of
the
group¡¯s
social
conservatism
but
insist
that
its
brand
of
ultraconservative
Islam
will
not
find
a
home
in
any
post-Assad
Syria
These
fighters
often
say
that
they
will
deal
with
conservative
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
later
but
that
right
now
they
need
them
in
the
fight
against
Assad
Other
rebels
view
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
a
transient
jihadi
group
that
will
move
onto
foreign
fronts
like
Afghanistan
or
Gaza
after
the
fall
of
Assad
Abu
Adnan
smirked
when
asked
to
comment
about
such
sentiments
especially
by
fellow
Sunni
fighters
whom
he
dismissed
as
the
brainwashed
He
repeated
that
the
idea
that
we
are
a
global
organization
or
that
we
have
some
other
goal
elsewhere
after
the
fall
is
not
true
He
was
emphatic
We
are
Syrians
He
admitted
that
we
also
have
foreigners
who
came
from
other
countries
but
he
explained
that
is
because
the
wounds
in
the
Arab
lands
are
the
same
wound
and
the
oppression
is
the
same
oppression
A
minute
I
always
feel
so
long
Think
of
me
and
your
chance
Less
and
less
as
if
by
the
end
of
life
We
separate
with
each
other
The
world
of
two
people
each
other
again
A
minute
I'm
drunk
wine
a
few
times
The
evening
of
that
day
I'm
a
night
did
not
return
you
want
to
A
minute
Appear
in
front
of
you
you
want
me
to
repent
But
time
constraints
no
waiting
a
minute
Is
the
morning
you
find
I'm
a
night
that
night
Who
knows
in
the
noon
time
I
am
the
soft
bed
happy
to
sleep
But
you
have
to
use
a
minute
Wake
me
up
the
rumble
of
the
scolded
I
feel
very
feel
shy
When
I
want
to
take
a
minute
to
make
up
But
you
never
give
me
a
chance
And
you
say
we
are
the
best
choice
to
leave
I
used
a
few
years
time
Build
a
charming
scenery
wall
And
now
you
say
collapse
will
collapse
I'm
unwilling
heart
want
to
take
a
minute
To
redeem
my
fault
I
beg
you
said
to
me
Not
I
do
not
give
you
the
opportunity
But
given
the
opportunity
you
have
to
cherish
So
we
each
other
to
leave
for
good
That
night
the
minutes
But
it
doesn't
make
you
took
from
my
dreams
May
the
minute
for
you
Is
already
in
the
past
for
me
A
minute
is
an
indelible
scar
Forever
in
your
heart
the
brand
mark
The
nine
seven
half
of
the
year
I
graduated
from
the
primary
school
took
more
than
two
months
holiday
oneself
in
boring
boring
nothing
for
me
to
do
Probably
because
I
was
in
primary
school
has
over
two
times
the
level
or
that
I
was
in
the
primary
school
stage
without
ambition
my
result
difference
make
them
disappointed
disappointed
again
in
helpless
situation
teachers
do
not
stay
in
my
class
From
the
beginning
to
repeat
things
because
be
informed
parents
I
have
the
opinion
very
much
but
that
s
not
for
me
to
say
but
parents
and
teachers
say
so
in
the
two
years
younger
than
I
classmates
together
side
by
side
I
was
very
uncomfortable
psychological
also
feel
very
guilty
Only
this
guilt
and
inner
pain
no
one
can
imagine
Then
to
the
junior
high
school
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
neighborhood
folks
have
advised
me
not
to
read
so
I
went
to
town
to
work
I
seem
to
be
somewhat
unwilling
heart
did
not
listen
to
their
opinions
and
think
of
reading
mind
reading
do
not
know
what
may
I
feel
lonely
stay
in
the
quiet
village
households
seem
dismal
alone
let
me
feel
very
afraid
so
I
read
no
matter
how
bad
but
also
to
the
nine
year
compulsory
education
school
But
I
think
the
day
time
is
long
etc
several
day
has
not
yet
come
psychological
anxious
Sometimes
I'm
afraid
aunt
nagging
uncle's
house
did
not
dare
to
go
have
been
at
home
with
And
from
that
time
I
love
to
read
a
Book
habits
mother's
good
at
saying
you
read
a
book
are
admitted
to
a
university
so
you
really
go
to
read
a
book
you
don't
read
I
was
so
mom
a
nag
well
I
hate
to
take
all
of
the
book
to
burn
My
graduation
exam
is
over
a
long
time
I
didn't
know
how
to
grade
their
own
have
been
waiting
when
my
anxiety
to
fifth
days
at
the
same
time
the
junior
middle
school
admission
notice
to
can
not
write
performance
I
can
not
find
out
their
performance
is
bad
or
good
not
over
the
admission
notice
I
was
happy
but
when
the
notice
it
but
found
that
there
was
no
money
at
home
for
me
to
read
and
I
feel
it
This
day
Friday
daddy
go
out
as
I
gather
books
go
home
and
left
me
and
my
mother
two
Father
outside
money
very
hard
a
week
later
did
not
wait
for
the
dad
who
come
back
home
I
was
boring
occasionally
also
help
mother
do
some
housework
but
most
of
the
time
I
am
a
person
sits
on
the
bed
or
on
the
wheelchair
When
I
was
home
to
sit
to
uncle
home
to
flow
because
the
uncle's
path
is
the
only
way
which
must
be
passed
on
the
junior
high
school
so
when
the
school
in
the
school
I'll
be
watching
them
back
and
forth
it
seems
that
I'm
reading
way
does
not
give
up
Father
borrow
money
did
not
come
back
but
the
family
tattle
and
prate
much
rise
when
aunt
in
my
ears
ago
often
nag
daddy
thing
I
feel
creepy
why
is
it
so
Dad
why
Dad
You
come
back
You
come
back
quickly
I
prefer
not
to
read
will
not
let
you
be
such
grievances
such
insults
Dad
Dad
What
are
you
Why
are
they
so
say
you
I
have
been
to
have
been
waiting
for
his
return
Aunt
said
your
father
too
do
bad
name
that
he
do
it
really
lost
your
face
For
a
start
I
don't
know
what
happened
the
mood
is
very
heavy
asked
aunt
how
Is
there
anything
so
so
serious
Aunt
aggravated
by
an
angry
tone
said
your
father
outside
in
order
to
give
you
borrow
books
first
to
your
aunt's
house
he
said
the
home
to
buy
cattle
need
to
borrow
money
so
aunt
to
know
no
such
thing
so
don't
borrow
To
the
ancient
city
of
leaf
Tingjia
your
father's
friends
said
to
buy
chemical
fertilizer
to
borrow
a
little
money
Tingjia
leaves
no
he
will
go
to
your
grandma's
house
to
you
two
uncle's
house
to
borrow
your
dad
said
is
to
build
a
house
your
uncle
happened
to
encounter
village
grow
there
ask
he
once
topic
was
exposed
he
had
to
go
to
Ningbo
and
the
town
of
Evergreen
s
aunt
s
home
to
borrow
they
have
had
to
go
to
Shangjie
discussed
In
fact
I
was
really
want
to
ask
why
he
did
know
go
to
Ningbo
to
evergreen
all
be
crystal
clear
isn't
he
is
immortal
But
I
think
if
I
really
ask
those
words
do
not
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
again
I
heard
a
few
times
she
simply
said
you
don't
read
simply
go
out
work
I
thought
if
Dad
comes
back
I
can't
read
but
sometimes
I
am
unwilling
heart
no
matter
what
was
advised
in
the
school
I
had
a
few
lessons
can
comfort
my
soul
As
for
the
aunt's
words
I
don't
want
to
hear
but
also
do
not
want
to
use
it
The
school
school
for
several
days
Dad
Don't
see
at
that
time
I
was
a
little
worried
but
those
tattle
and
prate
is
not
stopped
but
also
the
diffusion
constant
at
While
I
thought
in
my
mind
my
father
come
back
and
side
wanted
dad
to
lend
money
to
come
back
I
can
take
a
good
read
I
do
not
want
to
give
up
all
of
a
sudden
but
to
no
avail
since
the
tattle
and
prate
my
heart
was
tortured
to
death
Mom
In
addition
to
complaining
that
father
outside
sometimes
also
want
to
talk
to
scold
me
maybe
she
more
recently
than
I
was
upset
so
she
wants
to
say
I
she
said
to
me
and
I
don't
chew
sound
One
day
I
went
to
his
aunt's
house
because
the
boring
to
my
aunt's
house
behind
the
bamboo
inside
to
digging
up
bamboo
shoots
when
I
really
dig
vigorously
suddenly
heard
the
mother's
cry
I
came
down
to
see
his
aunt
said
Daddy
things
let
s
lose
face
so
my
mother
sometimes
hard
to
explain
for
oneself
sometimes
feel
helpless
because
she
feels
she
jumped
into
the
the
Yellow
River
wash
not
clear
so
she
felt
wronged
cry
In
fact
say
mother
instigated
is
possible
the
key
is
my
own
request
forcing
the
father
in
the
back
of
the
eternal
infamy
to
say
in
the
final
analysis
is
my
fault
so
I
ought
to
I
heard
my
mother
weeping
I
also
feel
very
sad
This
a
few
days
later
mother's
mood
has
not
been
good
if
not
more
I
see
my
mother
like
this
is
very
worried
After
a
few
days
of
school
another
week
has
passed
I
also
miss
dad
Don't
know
Dad
outside
doing
may
be
I
worry
most
X
x
on
the
evening
the
sun
nearly
down
hill
Dad
came
back
I
go
first
call
dad
like
my
father
and
several
years
not
to
meet
such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
say
uncle
s
contribution
but
not
all
because
I
have
three
hundred
yuan
to
make
books
uncle
didn't
go
with
me
in
the
said
dad
before
he
has
not
called
me
to
junior
high
school
but
a
three
again
three
advised
me
to
give
up
reading
now
papa
got
money
made
a
part
of
my
books
I
read
to
say
to
their
credit
is
a
little
exaggerated
Father
left
home
also
no
rest
was
mother
shouted
did
mother's
grievance
venting
gas
while
the
father
was
annoyed
do
not
know
to
whom
to
tell
he
ll
go
Mother
said
you
come
The
money
for
you
to
cheat
here
Oh
So
good
people
like
you
fool
money
you
go
begging
Dad
shouted
who
said
that
To
who
said
that
You
give
me
a
call
My
accusers
Mother
said
without
confrontation
the
village
has
spread
to
open
You
to
the
village
to
make
inquiries
will
know
You're
so
listen
to
them
they
have
so
good
Dad
said
Mother
said
your
sister-in-law
also
said
do
not
believe
you
can
go
and
ask
him
do
their
own
things
to
know
Later
my
father
also
do
not
know
to
have
to
confront
this
thing
Buleerle
But
the
father
and
mother
are
very
long
time
had
not
spoken
always
keep
silence
state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
very
so
stay
at
home
for
too
long
you
feel
so
lonely
and
boring
parents
also
I
have
no
job
but
feel
puzzled
think
it
over
and
over
again
had
no
friends
who
can
help
me
introduce
then
find
the
parents
remember
my
cousin
D
s
so
that
when
they
think
of
commissioned
sister-in-law
R's
called
D
took
me
to
the
city
to
work
F
F
city
is
located
on
the
edge
of
the
Fuchun
River
the
most
difficult
beautiful
county
is
also
my
hometown
city
administrative
center
Although
the
city
as
it
is
my
most
beautiful
dream
also
is
I
most
look
forward
to
come
to
one
of
the
city
but
because
life
economically
not
rich
or
because
I
was
in
the
city
without
known
relatives
so

Since

next
day
morning
speeding
and
returned
to
his
hometown
urged
me
to
go
to
the
city
to
do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or
promises
probably
at
that
time
I
have
been
in
the
dream
of
the
life
in
the
city
there's
nothing
to
refuse
the
And

while
sewing

while
another

told
me
A
Cheng
You

to
the
city

must
listen
to
your
cousin's
arrangement
don't
go
out
on
a
night
out
that
will
make
your
brother
worry
will
let
us
worry
there
is
the
question
of
your
life
must
be
well
orderly
and
you
wear
and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother
and
friends
will
look
down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said
you
know
now
but
really
to
the
city
after
you
is
it
right
Our
words
as
unheeded
advice
that
an
inlet
and
an
outlet
to
forget
about
and
do
I
hope
you
not
if
you
so
dad
wouldn't
want
to
control
you
The
night
his
father
for
the
first
time
to
drink
is
also
the
first
time
that
I
drank
tincture
MOET
drunk
I
in
the
night
imperceptibly
in
wheezing
to
sleep
Early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
I
also
in
outdoor
breathe
fresh
air
waiting
for
mother
made
breakfast
eat
a
good
meal
with
my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also
can
Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or
accept
it
D's
said
rest
assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her
I
will
give
him
his
money
saved
in
the
home
My
father
put
the
money
back
pocket
looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
that
here
was
the
last
miss
that
my
heart
is
full
of
hope
full
of
ideals
is
my
nostalgia
reminds
me
of
the
beauty
of
my
hometown
As
tears
like
springs
that
my
surging
mood
as
in
heaven
so
here
swear
resolutely
obey
D's
command
I
went
to
Lake
source
direction
to
horse
sword
shift
car
went
straight
to
the
F
town
Go
forward
with
great
strength
and
vigour
to
the
F
city
F
City
we
in
the
long-distance
passenger
station
of
the
car
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
city
I
think
it's
great
it
is
because
I
first
saw
the
perfect
city
probably
for
the
city
people
the
city
is
not
big
because
there
are
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
such
as
Shanghai
Hangzhou
Nanjing
are
so
But
I
look
I
see
it
is
because
I
have
no
contact
with
the
city
and
the
first
contact
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
novelty
I
felt
that
here
is
my
dream
of
heaven
D
s
first
got
out
of
the
car
I
have
to
get
off
the
streets
together
with
him
I
don't
know
what
this
is
what
Lane
Road
always
feel
in
the
alley
as
in
gossip
so
I
feel
I
can't
touch
the
North
East
and
touched
the
East
has
touched
the
north
deeply
he
was
puzzled
When
I
came
to
a
river
river
sides
erected
a
high-rise
blocks
I
always
thought
that
this
is
the
Fuchun
River
I
really
think
you
saw
the
Fuchun
River
I
was
a
sigh
and
said
the
Fuchun
River
does
not
have
such
a
river
I
didn't
necessarily
it
big
D's
said
this
is
not
the
Fuchun
River
but
an
amaranth
Pujiang
I
said
oh
It
is
my
illusion
Words
I
am
his
behind
but
when
we
are
at
the
crossroads
in
the
middle
turn
right
this
is
a
long
hill
road
Liuzhou
Road
building
is
bristly
and
let
me
feel
the
perfect
city
economy
is
thriving
and
prosperous
each
poineering
hardships
may
make
it
difficult
to
imagine
as
I
came
to
a
world
came
to
a
childhood
paradise
I
see
a
paradise
of
dream
in
my
nose
to
dazzle
along
the
road
of
hill
of
dragon
of
the
past
it
is
a
city
surrounded
by
people
in
and
out
of
the
mall
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
in
the
commercial
city
upstairs
to
write
the
Fuchun
River
commercial
city
it
seems
like
I
know
this
is
F
the
city's
most
bustling
shopping
center
the
most
bustling
sidewalks
I
just
want
to
say
the
city
of
F
F
really
great
I
came
to
this
strange
city
I
really
feel
in
this
strange
city
I
can
absorb
your
sunny
temperament
to
be
a
city
that
the
giants
I
am
going
to
show
themselves
When
I
didn't
see
enough
outside
downtown
scene
I
was
D's
to
the
commercial
city
there
are
all
the
stalls
food
stands
above
the
green
vegetables
eggplant
garlic
onion
bean
curd
a
kind
sister
church
where
D's
stall
led
me
here
and
sister
chatted
a
while
when
the
elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
is
to
eat
lunch
saw
us
big
brother
put
down
his
chopsticks
call
us
to
sit
down
then
O
O
said
A
Cheng
Your
dinner

had
dinner
yet
I
haven't
answered
D's
for
I
said
we
have
no
Big
brother
says
here
to
eat
not
home
to
burn
She
also
said
yes
Or
here
to
eat
even
home
to
burn
much
trouble
D's
said
not
so
polite
home
to
burn
it
it
didn't
take
long
very
fast
He
made
the
remarks
at
the
same
time
I
still
look
around
because
I
see
here
is
such
a
big
stall
is
also
the
first
time
saw
so
many
dishes
people
buy
vegetable
stall
So
my
curiosity
in
here
is
not
fun
When
I
put
the
spirit
are
concentrated
in
the
food
stalls
of
things
he
finished
on
the
go
I'm
still
hazy
a
bit
at
a
loss
situation
he
said
to
me
A
Cheng
we
go
I
didn't
hear
there
is
one
point
be
absent-minded
look
he
coaxed
out
of
said
hello
What's
on
your
mind
Told
you
so
loudly
did
not
hear
Go
I
said
oh
Elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband

pick
some
fresh
vegetables

you
bring
us
back
to
cook
he
and
I
left
sister
they
couple
booth
then
to
another
butcher
shop
stall
bought
several
kilograms
of
meat
left
the
commercial
city
and
imperceptibly
and
through
a
Malaysian
Road
came
to
a
named
Zhou
Jianong
lane
across
the
alley
alley
went
to
D's
house
D's
house
is
an
underground
garage
inside
a
very
the
smell
is
also
important
I
very
want
to
move
out
but
I
will
not
economic
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
environment
here
it
is
the
parents
of
thousand
exhort
enjoin
let
I
firmly
remember
them
you
want
me
to
listen
to
D's
so
I
had
to
reluctantly
stay
When
I
walked
inside
the
heat
from
the
outside
directly
to
heaven
so
I
really
feel
it's
hard
I
am
afraid
went
into
the
furnace
of
the
house
let
me
really
angry
be
ashamed
of
dying
When
I
was
in
the
hot
sun
dried
by
the
sun
at
the
same
time
D's
said
why
don't
you
come
in
Quickly
Wash
dishes
I
went
to
go
say
to
him
it
is
too
hot
I
have
a
bit
of
a
bear
D's
continued
hot
A
fan
Do
not
be
afraid
of
heat
a
long
time
to
get
over
I
come
too
but
we
insist
on
the
stand
A
man
should
be
afraid
of
tired
we
are
so
out
of
practice
I
said
oh
Came
to
give
him
food
finished
lunch
he's
out
let
me
have
a
rest
at
home
for
a
day
starting
tomorrow
I
promised
D's
a
boring
also
have
a
look
at
the
room
television
occasionally
to
bring
home
the
story
books
doubled
the
old
warm
up
in
primary
and
secondary
schools
the
residual
reading
difficulty
One
day
in
the
imperceptibly
in
the
past
soon
arrived
at
dusk
D's
also
returned
to
cook
I
don't
know
how
to
cook
so
there
are
a
lot
of
housework
is
D's
one
person
to
complete
I
can
only
one
wash
dishes
clean
the
room
health
or
what
other
are
not
good
At
night
after
dinner
D's
and
I
had
to
watch
TV
in
bed
TV
also
is
no
good
program
I
watched
a
imperceptibly
fell
asleep
Suddenly
I
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
I
will
readily
but
here
I
can
not
find
the
toilet
was
anxious
to
panic
I
find
that
I
finally
find
convenient
corner
when
I
finished
returned
was
a
patrol
car
through
here
I
was
found
by
police
as
a
thief
was
caught
The
car
out
of
the
two
patrol
to
check
my
ID
card
I
came
to
the
interior
from
my
bag
show
identity
cards
to
give
them
they
took
out
the
register
put
my
name
and
identity
card
number
is
recorded
in
it
and
again
and
again
I
ask
my
family
and
address
then
they
contact
D
s
asked
his
identity
asked
his
work
address
information
is
very
detailed
and
they
have
put
D
s
identity
as
a
pledge
export
to
a
television
set
let
him
leave
the
TV
invoice
and
specifications
to
verify
can
put
his
things
he
returned
to
the
He
had
to
accept
to
let
them
D's
until
the
patrol
had
gone
he
said
how
can
you
not
carefully
let
the
guard
discovered
I
said
I
don't
know
How
do
I
know
the
night
police
so
fiercely
knew
that
I
wouldn't
back
out
D's
continued
next
to
a
sharp
point
don't
be
so
idiotic
Know
or
not
Said
oh
Know
Put
out
the
light
then
we
sleep
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
sleep
at
night
because
the
room
was
at
night
is
also
very
difficult
to
eliminate
unless
the
outside
temperature
drops
to
the
upper
20s
degrees
after
midnight
there
may
be
more
comfortable
Wake
up
the
first
thing
I
do
is
to
wash
brush
work
then
I
put
a
few
of
the
ash
bucket
and
a
large
shovels
and
in
D
s
back
leading
me
to
play
first
In
fact
I
don't
know
what
is
hard
what
is
helpless
life
I
have
not
try
at
home
parents
regard
me
as
a
saint
as
for
at
that
time
I
feel
so
blessed
and
now
I
can
only
obey
D's
leadership
as
his
apprentice
I
came
to
the
city
gates
then
turn
to
the
Old
Road
South
Gate
Street
South
Gate
Street
rely
on
the
Fuchun
River
and
that
a
large
river
it
is
the
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
we
stand
position
is
the
Fuchun
River
ferry
terminal
just
because
it
is
against
the
direction
of
the
city
to
the
South
so
it
means
draw
road
also
known
as
South
Gate
Street
near
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
I
came
here
did
not
look
at
the
moon
not
here
on
vacation
trip
or
something
I
was
just
a
young
worker
come
to
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
many-storied
buildings
work
most
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
river
I
and
it
are
not
fate
I
climbed
to
the
six
floor
of
this
building
opened
the
door
there
are
several
woodworking
early
start
working
here
their
decoration
process
of
half
I
come
here
only
a
toilet
and
a
wing
not
paved
tiles
This
is
D
s
and
I
started
to
do
it
My
first
day
at
work
is
to
carry
cement
bag
or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too
much
I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
is
D
s
wake
me
from
this
dream
urged
me
to
go
to
work
I
mistily
mistily
to
get
up
go
to
work
work
on
the
path
of
two
feet
in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a
little
be
petrified
like
How
can
I
not
to
mention
the
spirit
Seems
to
me
the
wholeEven
if
more
magnificent
rhetoric
Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk
the
voice
Beat
the
floor
Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me
babble
learn
language
I
learned
to
language
in
the
river
The
first
word-mom
How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only
for
repel
mosquitoes
Breeze
send
me
to
sleep
But
regardless
of
the
eyebrows
climb
sweat
poured
Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite
write
of
word
Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
and
vertical
dignified
and
imposing
You
said
that
a
man
have
to
like
it
Young
i
was
not
sensible
Occasionally
make
a
mistake
You
taught
me
the
force
of
justice
I
keep
in
mind
your
word
Dare
not
have
a
bit
slight
In
order
to
build
a
quiet
environment
for
my
studies
The
already
heavy
burden
of
the
family
You
take
on
all
the
housework
and
farm
work
Even
if
was
too
tired
to
take
a
breath
Also
won't
let
me
take
part
in
I
was
moved
to
nothing
to
say
In
my
memory
You've
never
luxury
one
coin
You
let
me
know
what
is
bitter
What
is
sweet
In
your
reference
I
have
learned
to
pinch
and
scrape
On
the
way
setback
Several
times
i
want
to
surrender
You
full
of
incentive
of
look
in
the
eyes
You
earnestly
teaching
Let
me
confidence
Taken
the
pace
of
progress
Youth
at
a
loss
You
listen
to
me
dribs
and
drabs
And
give
me
all
of
the
analysis
and
directions
I
like
the
blind
man
to
regain
the
light
when
injustice
and
resentment

I

look

every

on

They

Guo
Jingming
said
my
friends
are
my
courage
to
live
and
they
give
me
your
ability
let
me
face
this
world
no
longer
panic
Those
who
have
and
be
crazy
with
me
with
sadness
with
cycling
through
the
thin
youth
friend
I
think
we
all
remember
the
youth
is
how
we
face
cannot
erase
the
traces
Xiao

went
to
Hainan
in
a

shop
as

Whenever
we
have
a
vacation
will
be
received
her
phone
call
she
received
the
text
message
she
always
likes
to
write
very
long
As
it
was
she
knew
I
was
a
very
insecure
afraid
to
lose
even
if
there
is
no
important
will
also
write
a
long
message
let
me
know
her
by
my
side
never
leave
Chen
is
a
very
clever
girl
but
in
the
study
does
not
enlighten
after
each
test
there
will
always
be
that
her
poor
grades
in
my
front
side
into
my
mouth
ice
cream
a
begged
me
to
help
her
with
We
have
been
together
for
9
years
so
only
a
piece
of
memory
I
always
thought
she
was
a
bright
child
happy
and
simple
life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
From
the
bright
sunlight
If
the
rain
from
the
cloud
Break
your
pride
Think
of
my
love
for
you
And
everything
shall
be
fine
Let
us
soar
let
us
fly
To
the
highest
height
And
everything
shall
be
fineLast
year
the
cancer
nearly
finished
me
off
However
with
the
accompaniment
of
my
best
friend
Candice
I
could
eventually
get
through
these
tough
time
Sometimes
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
always
stand
by
my
side
Last
summer
the
doctor
discovered
that
I
suffered
from
lung
cancer
At
that
moment
I
was
completely
shocked
All
memories
that
I
have
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
in
seconds
I
thought
I
was
going
to
leave
all
my
friends
my
family
and
all
people
I
loved
To
me
the
whole
world
was
just
sinking
Luckily
that
was
just
in
an
early
stage
and
the
doctor
said
that
I
had
I
great
chance
to
recover
after
a
series
of
treatments
But
he
warned
me
that
the
treatment
would
be
very
tough
and
painful
At
first
I
have
considered
to
refuse
the
treatment
However
after
I
have
though
about
all
of
my
valuable
friends
and
my
mom
and
dad
I
chose
to
take
the
chance
During
the
treatment
I
gradually
suffered
from
the
side
effects
The
number
of
hairs
on
my
head
declined
and
I
vomited
from
dawn
till
night
on
every
single
day
I
had
a
very
poor
appetite
and
I
nearly
had
no
desired
to
put
any
food
to
my
mouth
I
was
very
painful
and
I
was
thinking
about
giving
up
the
treatment
I
though
I
could
not
tolerate
it
anymore
However
with
the
support
and
encouragement
from
my
best
friend
Candice
I
have
eventually
made
it
through
the
rain
and
stand
up
once
again
Finally
I
recovered
One
summer
night
Candice
came
to
the
hospital
to
visit
me
We
sat
on
the
bench
that
facing
the
sea
The
sun
was
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
night
descended
We
chatted
underneath
the
stars
We
have
not
met
each
other
since
the
graduation
Candice
said
with
tears
on
her
face
Yes
I
have
never
thought
we
would
have
the
reunion
in
the
situation
I
said
She
kept
silent
with
her
tears
in
the
warm
gentle
breeze
We
have
been
best
friends
since
we
were
small
I
do
not
want
this
friendship
to
end
up
so
soon
She
cried
desperately
Zach
you
are
a
man
You
are
a
man
who
is
courageous
and
adventurous
You
should
have
that
guts
to
fight
for
your
life
and
people
around
you
But
Now
I
am
going
to
give
you
the
courage
you
need
She
lay
her
hand
on
me
Lord
please
give
this
little
boy
love
and
hope
to
face
the
obstacle
that
he
is
now
facing
Please
give
him
courage
to
help
him
to
find
the
way
Now
you
have
already
possessed
the
ability
to
fight
this
war
You
should
never
give
up
as
there
is
a
light
in
your
heart
and
shines
very
brightly
Since
them
I
understand
that
when
fate
is
tough
just
toughen
your
faith
With
a
smile
I
know
I
could
face
the
future
no
matter
what
lay
ahead
And
there's
a
hero
comes
along
with
the
strength
to
carry
on
My
dad
has
always
used
this
song
to
encourage
me
Until
he
passed
away
I
still
keep
this
song
in
my
iPod
and
listen
to
it
when
I
need
to
get
through
some
tough
time
To
me
this
song
does
not
only
symbolize
the
spirit
of
my
dad
but
also
mine
This
song
is
ubiquitous
in
various
singing
competitions
Regardless
of
its
singing
technique
the
beautiful
melody
and
those
meaningful
lyrics
has
helped
many
people
to
get
through
obstacles
This
fabulous
song
was
composed
by
American
singer-songwriter
Mariah
Carey
in
1993
and
definitely
performed
by
herself
The
song
mentioned
that
among
every
single
one
of
us
a
hero
lies
inside
our
heart
If
we
try
to
reach
into
our
soul
our
emptiness
will
disappear
There's
a
hero
if
you
look
inside
your
heart
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid
of
who
you
are
When
I
was
small
I
was
a
child
who
was
so
fragile
and
cried
easily
I
was
afraid
of
everything
I
was
so
this
and
small
and
when
my
classmates
bullied
me
all
I
would
do
was
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
and
cry
from
dawn
till
night
Worse
still
I
was
poor
in
academic
result
and
no
teachers
loved
me
On
these
days
I
found
myself
useless
and
believed
that
no
one
in
this
world
would
recognise
this
small
potato
I
was
so
desperate
Yet
in
one
dark
night
my
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
hand
was
so
large
and
warm
All
I
could
feel
was
the
love
and
hope
transmitted
through
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
and
to
my
heart
and
soul
Son
you
should
not
be
fragile
anymore
But
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
Now
I
am
going
to
recall
your
hero
from
your
soul
and
from
now
on
you
would
never
feel
lonely
anymore
My
hero
and
your
hero
have
already
stayed
together
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
Other
people
can
say
anything
they
want
to
say
Although
they
try
to
bring
you
down
you
will
never
allow
them
to
do
so
because
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
This
hero
will
always
stay
close
to
you
and
protect
you
forever
Afterwards
he
sang
this
song
to
me
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow
But
don't
let
anyone
to
tear
them
away
Since
then
whenever
I
need
to
face
any
problems
or
obstacles
alone
I
will
not
be
fragile
anymore
All
I
need
to
do
is
sing
Hero
along
with
my
hero
and
my
father's
hero
and
I
will
certainly
know
that
my
father
will
guide
me
where
I
should
go
I
know
that
there
is
a
light
in
me
and
shines
very
brightly
and
other
people
can
try
but
they
can
never
take
that
away
from
me
The
meeting
is
WangHai
Time
always
unknowingly
hurried
away
flash
Also
in
the
online
to
spend
a
few
years
Cry
also
laughed
Thousands
of
day
and
night
WangHai
roaming
A
thought
to
mature
Walk
to
the
friend
go
to
How
many
friends
already
not
disappear
Sitting
alone
in
the
space
is
cold
and
cheerless
Some
vague
sad
loss
Thankfully
Have
a
lot
of
friends
have
been
silent
about
Accompany
me
along
the
way
Always
buchibuqi
In
the
virtual
network
Deduce
true
feelings
Behind
the
screen
in
the
cold
And
each
wish
Whenever
the
birthday
Will
receive
blessings
of
friends
Very
often
I
moved
ShiXi
unceasingly
Thanks
friends
gifts
and
blessing
Because
of
you
Lonely
night
has
not
lonely
Because
of
you
My
birthday
is
not
cold
and
cheerless
Of
a
friend
said
I
am
not
alone
My
friend
Thousands
of
WanLiLi
just
a
moment
of
distance
Don't
need
name
also
need
not
face
Both
you
and
I
Thank
you
all

were
seeing
anyone
You
thanked
her
by
saying
It's
none
of
your
business
When
you
were
21
she
suggested
certain
careers
for
your
future
You
thanked
her
by
saying
I
don't
want
to
be
like
you
When
you
were
22
she
hugged
you
at
your
college
graduation
You
thanked
her
by
asking
whether
she
could
pay
for
a
trip
to
Europe
When
you
were
23
she
gave
you
furniture
for
your
first
apartment
You
thanked
her
by
telling
your
friends
it
was
ugly
When
you
were
24
she
met
your
fiance10
and
asked
about
your
plans
for
the
future
You
thanked
her
by
glaring
and
growling
Muuhh-ther
please
When
you
were
25
she
helped
to
pay
for
your
wedding
and
she
cried
and
told
you
how
deeply
she
loved
you
You
thanked
her
by
moving
halfway
across
the
country
When
you
were
30
she
called
with
some
advice
on
the
baby
You
thanked
her
by
telling
her
Things
are
different
now
When
you
were
40
she
called
to
remind
you
of
a
relative's
birthday
You
thanked
her
by
saying
you
were
really
busy
right
now
When
you
were
50
she
fell
ill
and
needed
you
to
take
care
of
her
You
thanked
her
by
reading
about
the
burden
parents
become
to
their
children
And
then
one
day
she
quietly
died
And
everything
you
never
did
came
crashing
down
like
thunder
Rock
me
baby
rock
me
all
night
long
The
hand
who
rocks
the
cradle...may
rock
the
world
Let
us
take
a
moment
of
the
time
just
to
pay
tribute
and
show
appreciation
to
the
person
called
mom
though
some
may
not
say
it
openly
to
their
mother
There's
no
substitute
for
her
Cherish
every
single
moment
Though
at
times
she
may
not
be
the
best
of
friends
may
not
agree
to
our
thoughts
she
is
still
your
mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left
Thomas
Carlyle
lived
from
1795
until
1881
He
was
a
10000

Scot
essayist
and
historian
During
his
lifetime
he
became
one
of
the
world's
greatest
writers
But
he
was
a
human
and
storage

On
October

1826
wow

Carlyle
married
his
secretary
Jane
Welsh
She
was
an
intelligent
attractive
and
somewhat
temperamental
daughter
of
a
well-to-do
doctor
They
had
their
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
but
still
loved
Bathroom
Vanities
each
other
dearly
After
their
marriage
Jane
continued
to
serve
as
his
secretary
But
after
several
years
of
marriage
Jane
became
ill
Being
Bathroom
Mirrors
a
hard
worker
Carlyle
became
so
absorbed
in
his
writings
that
he
let
Jane
continue
working
for
several
weeks
after
she
became
ill
She
had
cancer
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
slow
growing
kind
she
finally
became
confined
to
her
bed
Although
Carlyle
loved
her
Bathroom
Accessories
dearly
he
very
seldom
found
time
to
stay
with
her
long
He
was
busy
with
his
work
when
Jane
died
they
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
for
the
service
The
day
Glass
Basin
was
a
miserable
day
It
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
Following
the
funeral
Carlyle
went
back
to
his
home
He
was
taking
it
pretty
hard
He
went
up
the
stairs
to
Jane's
room
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
her
bed
He
sat
there
thinking
Shower
Enclosures
about
how
little
time
he
had
spent
with
her
and
wishing
so
much
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
differently
Noticing
her
diary
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
picked
it
up
and
began
to
steel
shelving
read
it
Suddenly
he
seemed
shocked
He
saw
it
There
on
one
page
she
had
written
Interior
Doors
a
single
line
Yesterday
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
and
it
was
like
heaven
I
love
him
so
Something
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
He
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
that
he
meant
so
much
to
her
He
thought
of
all
wow
gold
australia
the
times
he
had
gone
about
his
work
without
thinking
about
and
noticing
her
Then
Carlyle
turned
the
page
in
the
diary
There
he
noticed
she
racking
had
written
some
words
that
broke
his
heart
I
have
listened
all
day
to
hear
his
steps
in
the
hall
but
now
it
is
late
and
I
guess
he
won't
come
today
Carlyle
read
a
little
more
in
the
book
Then
he
threw
it
down
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Some
of
his
friends
found
him
at
the
grave
his
buy
wow
gold
australia
face
buried
in
the
mud
His
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
Tears
continued
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
He
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
If
I
had
only
known
if
I
had
only
known
But
it
was
too
late
for
Carlyle
She
was
dead
After
Jane's
death
Carlyle
made
world
of
warcraft
gold
for
sale
little
attempt
to
write
again
The
historians
say
he
lived
another
15
years
weary
bored
and
a
partial
recluse
I
share
the
story
with
in
the
hope
that
you
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
While
our
loved
ones
must
have
the
money
we
make
to
live
it
is
the
love
we
have
that
they
really
want
Give
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
It
is
not
easy
to
define
what
kind
of
meaning
to
the
enterprise
culture
because
the
enterpise
culture
stems
from
the
ration
and
reality
which
should
be
related
to
the
regulations
or
how
to
react
to
the
risk
of
management
or
market
instead
of
just
focusing
on
training
and
meeting
which
should
be
related
to
the
proportion
of
thoughts
of
belonging
to
our
company
and
benefitting
our
company
in
the
difficulty
Sometimes
the
puzzled
people
are
always
in
the
mess
of
understanding
of
why
the
itemized
regulations
could
not
optimize
the
operation
and
not
regulate
the
action
of
some
officials
who
always
abused
the
power
to
benefit
themselves
which
lead
to
the
argument
that
as
long
as
the
company
is
so
large
that
the
culture
of
enterprise
is
absolutly
difficult
to
be
built
up
Different
people
with
different
education
background
and
different
comprehension
of
society
would
not
be
integrated
to
the
common
recognition
of
enterprise
culture
which
is
the
crux
to
help
the
company
be
prosperous
In
spite
of
training
many
officials
there
are
lots
of
bottlenecks
which
should
be
smoothed
and
holes
which
should
be
covered
so
we
must
work
out
some
measures
to
make
our
company
step
on
the
right
road
Regulations
are
parts
of
the
enterprise
culture
making
the
road
straight
but
what
kind
of
regulations
are
suitful
to
the
state-owned
company
The
regulation
are
always
eroded
by
dereliction
and
are
not
always
strickly
implemented
by
some
departments
Frankly
speaking
the
enterprise
culture
is
just
having
some
aspects
in
consciousness
frequently
dominating
the
behavior
which
would
give
us
some
reference
on
how
to
enact
the
detailed
regulations
could
get
the
return
as
expected
The
most
important
thing
related
to
the
enterprise
culture
is
how
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
in
the
every
respect
of
operation
We
must
detail
every
process
of
how
to
control
the
cost
and
how
to
make
the
work
efficient
and
rational
If
employee
could
make
their
regulations
rooted
in
mind
they
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
keep
them
from
dereliction
and
would
try
their
best
to
devote
the
wisdom
to
benifitting
our
company.For
example
The
flaws
in
human
nature
and
the
shortage
of
wealth
would
seduce
the
officals
to
accept
the
secret
money
from
agencies
who
are
intended
to
pull
down
the
officals
by
all
kinds
of
tactics
and
if
the
officals
are
too
fragile
to
resist
the
gifts
they
would
be
united
with
agencies
to
cheat
our
company
so
the
task
which
brooks
no
delay
is
the
education
brainwashing
and
making
the
severe
punishment
happen
without
them
the
enterprise
culture
is
like
the
moon
in
water
like
the
flowers
in
mist
like
the
stupid
being
called
clever
What
is
the
quintessence
of
the
enterprise
culture
It
is
easy
or
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
conclusion
because
it
is
a
hard
job
to
change
people¡¯s
mindset
which
is
always
in
the
prejustice.So
at
first
we
must
scrutinize
the
origin
of
the
prejustice
why
are
so
many
people
always
just
negating
others
because
we
are
extremely
lack
of
communication
to
understand
with
each
other
lacking
of
wisdom
to
tell
the
right
and
the
wrong
lacking
of
the
wide
chest
to
tolerate
the
different
ideas
wnich
lead
to
misunderstand
among
people
and
to
form
the
impasse
to
flexibly
resolve
the
thorny
problem.There
are
some
words
similar
and
implicated
with
the
word
culture
in
dictionary
such
as
communication
concoct
cooperation
coordination
copartner
control¡±
giving
us
some
metaphor
or
euphemism
that
enterprise
culture
must
depend
on
the
communication
cooperation
must
control
the
ridiculous
behavior
of
some
officials
must
concoct
the
atmosphere
from
stiff
suffocated
environment
to
the
active
creative
philosophical
philanthropic
state
of
mindset
of
everyone.But
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
behavior
spontaneously
follow
the
bright
side
of
human
being
just
because
of
the
fragile
and
selfish
nature
of
people
with
some
ignorant
knowledge
about
themselves
so
using
the
regulations
to
control
the
devil
in
their
mindset
and
encouraging
the
bold
attitude
to
resolve
the
present
and
history
problem
is
the
essential
way
of
making
the
enterprise
culture
alive
and
giving
the
light
to
the
employee
We
must
change
the
thoughts
that
we
are
isolated
by
others
we
are
just
living
for
ourself
we
are
just
focusing
on
our
private
cases
to
the
thoughts
that
if
we
can
help
each
other
if
we
believe
in
the
philosophy
of
strengthenning
the
consciousness
of
doing
the
job
positively
and
wisely
getting
good
return
we
can
achieve
the
goal
of
making
our
company
profitful
and
competitive
even
making
our
life
happy
Why
are
the
employee
always
having
no
enthusiasm
and
lacking
of
a
little
responsibility
in
their
job?why
are
there
lots
of
complaint
in
our
company?why
are
the
talented
people
resigning
quickly
from
our
company?Yes
the
salary
is
the
key
and
having
no
feeling
in
cooperation
unity
belonging
and
having
not
the
promising
future
are
the
fundamental
reasons
which
steamrollerred
the
spirit
to
be
loyal
to
company
so
putting
the
importance
of
employee
in
priority
is
the
way
of
having
the
high
competition
in
this
globallized
world
A
healthy
company
is
the
one
that
urgently
need
the
creative
advices
from
employee
in
stead
of
closing
their
eyes
filling
in
their
ears
in
front
of
the
employee
who
may
have
some
profound
and
pragmatic
ideas
which
maybe
benifit
to
the
operation
of
our
company.But
how
to
distinguish
the
good
ideas
or
the
wrong
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
leaders
who
must
look
through
everything
including
themselves
and
others
adding
that
they
must
comprehend
the
logic
of
mindset
and
behavior
of
themself
To
be
leaders
the
open
attitude
is
the
good
way
to
rationalize
the
management
adopting
the
positive
way
to
eliminate
the
flaws
in
the
structure
and
to
attain
the
goal
with
attacking
the
black
hands¡±
instead
of
always
being
in
defensive
measure
of
healing
the
fissure
in
management
that
is
deficient
in
courage
and
wisdom.It
is
also
one
part
of
the
enterprise
culture.Frankly
saying
having
good
return
to
our
company
is
dominated
by
the
fate
by
the
hearts
of
all
employee
by
the
regulations
by
the
rational
philosophy
by
the
authentic
wisdom
Service
is
the
culture
it
sounds
like
simple
but
complicated
and
profound
if
you
want
to
make
it
better
and
better
How
to
do
service
is
the
important
culture
of
enterprise
which
could
attract
many
people
to
take
our
flights
again
and
again.We
can
ask
a
simple
question
that
if
you
look
up
to
see
the
twinkled
stars
in
night
what
make
you
comfortable?The
answer
is
easy
the
bright
the
color
make
you
feel
comfortable
which
can
make
us
have
some
comprehension
that
if
you
make
people¡¯s
body
such
as
eye
ear
limbs
nose
heart
feel
nice
your
service
is
the
nice
service
if
you
make
the
customers
angry
you
failed
in
doing
service.So
you
must
think
over
how
to
make
the
customers
feel
better
is
the
best
way
to
learn
how
to
give
service
to
these
arrogant
and
hypercritical
customers
Above
all
We
can
understand
that
if
you
have
regulations
in
your
mindset
which
sometimes
is
selfish
and
Out
of
my
window
the
darkness
gave
me
a
signal:if
you
are
habitted
in
the
darkness
of
heart
you
would
be
dissappionted
for
ever.sometimes
I
want
to
find
the
way
of
making
me
in
the
positive
attitude
to
the
life
but
always
are
beated
by
my
experiences
which
cutted
off
the
robe
attached
to
the
sunshine.but
the
frustrated
happenning
is
not
the
domination
which
converts
my
good
intention
to
the
devil
the
domination
is
my
thoughts
which
are
sometimes
not
superficial
but
profound
gives
me
the
light
and
warm
to
live
simply
and
happily
What
kind
of
thoughts
would
release
my
pressure
and
gives
me
the
ability
to
survive
in
the
chilly
and
choppy
reality
which
would
distort
the
heart
fragile
to
the
fragmentary
condition
or
make
the
heart
wisom
strong
get
the
meaning
of
life
which
would
push
me
to
the
heaven
with
lots
of
beauty
and
full
I
would
say
that
my
thoughts
is
related
to
the
thoughts
themselves
if
you
can
change
the
thoughts
quickly
and
correctedly
you
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
pusure
the
objects
you
want;if
you
are
stubborn
enough
you
would
be
easily
defeated
by
the
fate
which
urgently
need
the
wisdom
light
to
cover
the
black
in
the
mindset
full
of
good
and
evil
When
I
was
a
child
I
do
not
know
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
and
have
no
faith
which
would
comfort
my
soul
to
give
me
a
light
would
direct
my
road
to
the
tranquillized
home
My
pressure
is
from
my
family
where
my
father
is
not
a
reasonable
person
and
had
no
ideas
on
how
to
cultivate
my
individual
personality
and
my
character
so
in
the
long
time
I
felt
the
life
of
mine
is
in
hell
even
if
I
have
food
to
eat
have
cloth
to
wear
but
my
heart
was
in
deep
frustration
and
had
much
hatre
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
shaping
my
thoughts
that
the
life
had
not
power
to
lift
me
from
the
miserable
conditions.after
long
long
time
the
climate
has
been
changed
to
more
warm
the
rivers
have
been
changed
to
more
polluted
the
hearts
of
many
people
have
been
changed
by
desire
for
money
to
be
vicious
my
god
has
given
me
the
enlight
that
if
you
can
comprehend
the
love
the
truth
you
can
have
sheft
below
the
sunshine
which
would
fill
you
and
warm
you
so
it
is
my
fortunation
I
can
get
the
hints
from
god
giving
me
the
truth
which
fattened
my
twisted
raods
in
the
mist
and
I
can
smile
happily
and
never
be
frustrated
again
Even
if
I
explain
the
understanding
of
love
and
truth
again
and
again
lots
of
people
still
had
lof
of
question
on
my
comprehension
about
the
thoughts
as
same
as
my
past.in
my
past
I
was
puzzled
intensifiedly
on
some
meaningful
words.some
people
said
to
me
the
words
wisdom
but
it
is
like
a
fool
who
can
not
distinguish
what
is
right
or
wrong
I
am
delayed
to
understand
the
truth
which
stumbled
my
existence
and
made
me
fall
to
hell.but
the
darkness
is
not
always
having
no
light
maybe
my
god
has
pity
on
me
one
day
I
found
thoughts
can
change
my
action
my
attitude
to
the
life
I
confronted
that
is
in
the
embarrassed
condition.after
I
have
been
changed
to
the
peace
life
by
the
fresh
way
of
thinking
I
can
in
confidence
make
a
conclusion
that
please
believing
in
the
god¡¯s
soul
that
tell
you
what
is
yours
what
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
this
world
worthy
pusuring
you
should
love
should
dent
the
suffering
you
have
got
and
smiling
in
the
darkness
stubborn
and
everyone
would
follow
the
regulations
rooted
in
your
heart
thinking
of
the
company
as
your
own
our
enterprise
would
be
promising.The
safety
and
service
is
the
crux
to
our
enterprise
we
must
strengthen
our
consciousness
to
keep
them
in
our
mind
and
do
our
best
to
support
it
VIRTUE
is
like
a
rich
stone
best
plain
set
and
surely
virtue
is
best
in
a
body
that
is
comely
though
not
of
delicate
features
and
that
hath
rather
dignity
of
presence
than
beauty
of
aspect
Neither
is
it
almost
seen
that
very
beautiful
persons
are
otherwise
of
great
virtue
as
if
nature
were
rather
busy
not
to
err
than
in
labor
to
produce
excellency
And
therefore
they
prove
accomplished
but
not
of
great
spirit
and
study
rather
behavior
than
virtue
But
this
holds
not
always
for
Augustus
Caesar
Titus
Vespasianus
Philip
le
Belle
of
France
Edward
the
Fourth
of
England
Alcibiades
of
Athens
Ismael
the
Sophy
of
Persia
were
all
high
and
great
spirits
and
yet
the
most
beautiful
men
of
their
times
In
beauty
that
of
favor
is
more
than
that
of
color
and
that
of
decent
and
gracious
motion
more
than
that
of
favor
That
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
cannot
express
no
nor
the
first
sight
of
the
life
There
is
no
excellent
beauty
that
hath
not
some
strangeness
in
the
proportion
A
man
cannot
tell
whether
Apelles
or
Albert
Durer
were
the
more
trifler
whereof
the
one
would
make
a
personage
by
geometrical
proportions
the
other
by
taking
the
best
parts
out
of
divers
faces
to
make
one
excellent
Such
personages
I
think
would
please
nobody
but
the
painter
that
made
them
Not
but
I
think
a
painter
may
make
a
better
face
than
ever
was
but
he
must
do
it
by
a
kind
of
felicity
as
a
musician
that
maketh
an
excellent
air
in
music
and
not
by
rule
A
man
shall
see
faces
that
if
you
examine
them
part
by
part
you
shall
find
never
a
good
and
yet
altogether
do
well
If
it
be
true
that
the
principal
part
of
beauty
is
in
decent
motion
certainly
it
is
no
marvel
though
persons
in
years
seem
many
times
more
amiable
pulchrorum
autumnus
pulcher
for
no
youth
can
be
comely
but
by
pardon
and
considering
the
youth
as
to
make
up
the
comeliness
Beauty
is
as
summer
fruits
which
are
easy
to
corrupt
and
cannot
last
and
for
the
most
part
it
makes
a
dissolute
youth
and
an
age
a
little
out
of
countenance
but
yet
certainly
again
if
it
light
well
it
maketh
virtue
shine
and
vices
blush
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
It
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really

running
up
to
the

father
to
shake

again
and
again
until
it
was
firm
enough
As
time
passed
there
were
other
rules
to
learn
Always
do
your
best.""Do
it
now.""Never
lie
And
most
importantly
"You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
By
my
teens
he
wasn't
telling
me
what
to
do
anymore
which
was
scary
and
heady
at
the
same
time
He
provided
perspective
not
telling
me
what
was
around
the
great
corner
of
life
but
letting
me
know
there
was
a
lot
more
than
just
today
and
the
next
which
I
hadn't
thought
of
One
day
I
realize
now
there
was
a
change
I
wasn't
trying
to
please
him
so
much
as
I
was
trying
to
impress
him
I
never
asked
him
to
come
to
my
football
games
He
had
a
high-pressure
career
and
it
meant
driving
through
most
of
Friday
night
But
for
all
the
big
games
when
I
looked
over
at
the
sideline
there
was
that
familiar
fedora
And
by
God
did
the
opposing
team
captain
ever
get
a
firm
handshake
and
a
gaze
he
would
remember
Then
a
school
fact
contradicted
something
he
said
Impossible
that
he
could
be
wrong
but
there
it
was
in
the
book
These
accumulated
over
time
along
with
personal
experiences
to
buttress
my
own
developing
sense
of
values
And
I
could
tell
we
had
each
taken
our
own
perfectly
normal
paths
I
began
to
see
too
his
blind
spots
his
prejudices
and
his
weaknesses
I
never
threw
these
up
at
him
He
hadn't
to
me
and
anyway
he
seemed
to
need
protection
I
stopped
asking
his
advice
the
experiences
he
drew
from
no
longer
seemed
relevant
to
the
decisions
I
had
to
make
He
volunteered
advice
for
a
while
But
then
in
more
recent
years
politics
and
issues
gave
way
to
talk
of
empty
errands
and
always
to
ailments
From
his
bed
he
showed
me
the
many
sores
and
scars
on
his
misshapen
body
and
all
the
bottles
for
medicine
Sometimes
he
confided
I
would
just
like
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
not
wake
up
After
much
thought
and
practice
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
one
night
last
winter
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
and
remembered
for
an
instant
those
terrifying
dark
holes
in
another
house
35
years
before
I
told
my
fatherhow
much
I
loved
him
I
described
all
the
things
people
were
doing
for
him
But
I
said
he
kept
eating
poorly
hiding
in
his
room
and
violating
the
doctor's
orders
No
amount
of
love
could
make
someone
else
care
about
life
I
said
it
was
a
two-way
street
He
wasn't
doing
his
best
The
decision
was
his
He
said
he
knew
how
hard
my
words
had
been
to
say
and
how
proud
he
was
of
me
I
had
the
best
teacher
I
said
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
He
smiled
a
little
And
we
shook
hands
firmly
for
the
last
time
Several
days
later
at
about
4
A.M
my
mother
heard
Dad
shuffling
about
their
dark
room
I
have
some
things
I
have
to
do
he
said
He
paid
a
bundle
of
bills
He
composed
for
my
mother
a
long
list
of
legal
and
financial
what-to-do's
in
case
of
emergency
And
he
wrote
me
a
note
Then
he
walked
back
to
his
bed
and
laid
himself
down
He
went
to
sleep
naturally
And
he
did
not
wake
up
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial
Party
committees
have
created
detailed
policies
to
improve
their
working
style
as
required
by
the
country's
core
leadership
With
these
measures
Party
authorities
are
attempting
to
get
closer
to
the
public
experts
said
We
have
seen
lots
of
fresh
working
styles
from
the
newly
elected
Party
leaders
such
as
fewer
cliches
at
conferences
no
traffic
controls
during
inspection
tours
and
so
on
said
Zhu
Lijia
a
professor
of
public
administration
research
at
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Governance
But
Party
authorities
should
enhance
supervision
and
those
who
violate
regulations
should
be
punished
he
added
In
a
10-item
regulation
issued

reception
dinner
times
should
be
limited
to
less
than
45
minutes
in
government
agencies
According
to
the

a
10-item
regulation
issued
recently
Provincial-level
officials
are
required

more
frequently
to
listen
to
the

a
response
to
the
eight
measures
put
forward

by
the
newly

the
eight
measures
officials
should
reduce
bureaucratic
meetings
cut
spending
on

arrange
fewer
traffic
restrictions
and
eliminate
extravagant

Many
provincial-level
Party
committees
have
already
made
efforts
to
implement
the
measures
When
government

and
main
Party
leaders
a
term
that
usually
refers
to
Party
chiefs

the
Jiangsu
provincial
Party
authority
said
Apart
from
the
provincial
Party
committees
many
State-owned
enterprises
and
institutes
also
put
forward
different
measures
to
improve
their
working
style
The
Party

of
China
Construction
Bank
issued
10
measures
on
Dec
10
requiring

During
a
post-election
interview
for
Nightline
Barbara
Walters
asked
the
president
why
the
hug
appeared
so
heartfelt
Cause
I
love
my
wife
Obama
responded
And
also
I
hadn¡¯t
seen
him
in
a
while
added
Michelle
Obama
who
said
their
grueling
campaign
schedules
made
them
two
ships
passing
in
the
night
And
the
first
time
I
saw
him
was
when
I
walked
onstage
to
greet
him
she
continued
And
that¡¯s
my
honey
giving
me
a
hug
I
love
giving
you
hugs
the
president
said
smiling
at
her
After
watching
that
sentimental
moment
Walters
asked
the
First
Couple
how
they
keep
the
fire
in
their
marriage
alive
We¡¯ve
been
married
now
20
years
and
like
every
marriage
I
think
you
have
your
ups
and
you
have
your
downs
the
president
said
But
if
you
work
through
the
tough
times
the

Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation

the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would

abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa

on
Russian

of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials

unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act

the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as

in
that
sphere
The

is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take

Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human

commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
in
November
1989

Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the

area
of

as
is

Users
shall
be
responsible
for
reclaiming
the

Land
Administration
Law
stipulates
Wang
Yunkun
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of
compensated
land
and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State
Council
or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens
or
hundreds
of
years
he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures
from

on

They

and

Mall
are
set
to
strengthen
their
lead
Tmall
and
Jingdong

have
gradually
become
the
driving
force
of
the
nation's
e-commerce

International
Turnover
in

billion

in

a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the
market
in

did
not
say
how
much

share
the

In

Tmall

accounted
for
more

70
percent
of

to
Web
pages
in
the
B2C

from

Although

the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's

industry
is
set

in

partly
because

18
years
on
the
windswept
Robben
Island
off
Cape
Town
The
former
president
was
admitted
to
a
Pretoria
hospital
on
December
8
and
this
was
his
longest
stay
in
hospital
since
he
was
released
from
prison
in
1990
Current
President
Jacob
Zuma
visited
Mandela
on
Christmas
Day
and
said
the
former
South
African
leader
was
doing
much
better
making
progress
and
in
good
spirits
Mandela
was
also
admitted
to
hospital
in
February
because
of
abdominal
pain
but
released
the
following
day
after
a
keyhole
examination
showed
there
was
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
him
He
has
spent
most
of
his
time
since
then
in
another
home
in
Qunu
his
ancestral
village
in
the
impoverished
Eastern
Cape
province
His
poor
health
has
prevented
him
from
making
any
public
appearances
in
the
past
two
years
although
he
has
continued
to
receive
high-profile
visitors
including
former
US
President
Bill
Clinton
earlier
this
year
Mandela
became
South
Africa's
first
black
president
after
the
country's
first
all-race
elections
in
1994
After
his
release
from
prison
he
used
his
popularity
to
push
for
reconciliation
between
whites
and
blacks
which
became
the
bedrock
of
the
post-apartheid
Rainbow
Nation
Mandela
stepped
down
as
president
in
1999
after
one
term
in
office
and
has
largely
been
absent
from
public
life
for
the
last
decade.Abu
Adnan
smirked
from
behind
his
black
balaclava
his
auburn
whiskers
peeking
through
the
fabric
as
the
corners
of
his
mouth
rose
A
religious
scholar
and
Shari¡®a
law
official
in
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
leadership
in
the
Aleppo
area
the
35-year-old
had
a
ready
answer
for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We
know
the
West
and
its
oppressive
ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N
Security
Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity
Smokers
need
not
apply
A
potential
recruit
must
undertake
a
10-day
religious-training
course
to
ascertain
his
understanding
of
religion
his
morals
his
reputation
A
15-to-20-day
military-training
program
follows
That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
the
vehicle
including
Abu
Adnan
who
silently
approached
the
car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not
introduce
himself
until
I
asked
who
he
was
later
We
drove
to
a
small
cold
concrete
room
with
a
tiny
window
that
barely
let
in
any
light
from
an
already
overcast
sky
We
sat
among
boxes
of
long-life
milk
and
bags
of
blankets
and
winter
clothes
waiting
to
be
distributed
Our
host
the
driver
tried
to
start
a
portable
gas
heater
but
there
was
no
gas
America
has
called
us
terrorists
because
it
says
that
some
of
our
tactics
bear
the
fingerprints
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de
guerre
of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
Israel
The
U.S
Treasury
Department
has
also
slapped
financial
sanctions
against
two
men
it
believes
are
senior
leaders
in
the
militia
group
Maysar
Ali
Musa
Abdallah
al-Juburi
and
Anas
Hasan
Khattab
Recent
media
reports
also
mention
one
Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
to
bakeries
We
are
keeping
the
price
of
bread
at
15
lira
about
21
U.S
cents
which
was
its
true
price
Abu
Adnan
said
adding
that
transgressors
would
be
punished
according
to
Shari¡®a
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
also
thus
far
avoided
indiscriminate
civilian
casualties
That¡¯s
not
to
say
that
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
have
fierce
critics
especially
within
rebel
circles
In
addition
to
its
civilian
detractors
many
more
secular-minded
fighters
are
wary
of
the
group¡¯s
social
conservatism
but
insist
that
its
brand
of
ultraconservative
Islam
will
not
find
a
home
in
any
post-Assad
Syria
These
fighters
often
say
that
they
will
deal
with
conservative
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
later
but
that
right
now
they
need
them
in
the
fight
against
Assad
Other
rebels
view
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
a
transient
jihadi
group
that
will
move
onto
foreign
fronts
like
Afghanistan
or
Gaza
after
the
fall
of
Assad
Abu
Adnan
smirked
when
asked
to
comment
about
such
sentiments
especially
by
fellow
Sunni
fighters
whom
he
dismissed
as
the
brainwashed
He
repeated
that
the
idea
that
we
are
a
global
organization
or
that
we
have
some
other
goal
elsewhere
after
the
fall
is
not
true
He
was
emphatic
We
are
Syrians
He
admitted
that
we
also
have
foreigners
who
came
from
other
countries
but
he
explained
that
is
because
the
wounds
in
the
Arab
lands
are
the
same
wound
and
the
oppression
is
the
same
oppression
A
minute
I
always
feel
so
long
Think
of
me
and
your
chance
Less
and
less
as
if
by
the
end
of
life
We
separate
with
each
other
The
world
of
two
people
each
other
again
A
minute
I'm
drunk
wine
a
few
times
The
evening
of
that
day
I'm
a
night
did
not
return
you
want
to
A
minute
Appear
in
front
of
you
you
want
me
to
repent
But
time
constraints
no
waiting
a
minute
Is
the
morning
you
find
I'm
a
night
that
night
Who
knows
in
the
noon
time
I
am
the
soft
bed
happy
to
sleep
But
you
have
to
use
a
minute
Wake
me
up
the
rumble
of
the
scolded
I
feel
very
feel
shy
When
I
want
to
take
a
minute
to
make
up
But
you
never
give
me
a
chance
And
you
say
we
are
the
best
choice
to
leave
I
used
a
few
years
time
Build
a
charming
scenery
wall
And
now
you
say
collapse
will
collapse
I'm
unwilling
heart
want
to
take
a
minute
To
redeem
my
fault
I
beg
you
said
to
me
Not
I
do
not
give
you
the
opportunity
But
given
the
opportunity
you
have
to
cherish
So
we
each
other
to
leave
for
good
That
night
the
minutes
But
it
doesn't
make
you
took
from
my
dreams
May
the
minute
for
you
Is
already
in
the
past
for
me
A
minute
is
an
indelible
scar
Forever
in
your
heart
the
brand
mark
The
nine
seven
half
of
the
year
I
graduated
from
the
primary
school
took
more
than
two
months
holiday
oneself
in
boring
boring
nothing
for
me
to
do
Probably
because
I
was
in
primary
school
has
over
two
times
the
level
or
that
I
was
in
the
primary
school
stage
without
ambition
my
result
difference
make
them
disappointed
disappointed
again
in
helpless
situation
teachers
do
not
stay
in
my
class
From
the
beginning
to
repeat
things
because
be
informed
parents
I
have
the
opinion
very
much
but
that
s
not
for
me
to
say
but
parents
and
teachers
say
so
in
the
two
years
younger
than
I
classmates
together
side
by
side
I
was
very
uncomfortable
psychological
also
feel
very
guilty
Only
this
guilt
and
inner
pain
no
one
can
imagine
Then
to
the
junior
high
school
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
neighborhood
folks
have
advised
me
not
to
read
so
I
went
to
town
to
work
I
seem
to
be
somewhat
unwilling

did
not
listen
to
their
opinions
and
think
of
reading

do
not
know
what
may
I
feel
lonely
stay
in
the
quiet
village
households
seem
dismal
alone
let
me
feel
very
afraid
so
I
read
no
matter
how
bad
but
also
to
the
nine
year
compulsory
education
school
But
I
think
the
day

is

Sometimes
I'm
afraid

And
from
that
time
I
love
to

a
Book
habits
mother's
good
at
saying
you
read
a
book
are
admitted
to
a
university
so
you
really
go
to
read
a
book
you
don't
read
I
was
so
mom
a
nag
well
I
hate
to
take
all
of
the
book
to
burn
My
graduation
exam
is
over
a
long
time
I
didn't
know
how
to
grade
their
own
have
been
waiting
when
my
anxiety
to
fifth
days
at
the
same
time

not

I
can
not

out
their
performance
is

or

over
the
admission
notice
I
was
happy
but
when
the
notice
it
but
found
that
there
was
no
money
at
home
for
me
to
read
and
I
feel
it
This
day
Friday

home
and
left
me
and
my
mother

Father
outside
money
very
hard
a
week
later
did
not
wait
for
the
dad
who
come
back
home
I
was
boring
occasionally
also
help
mother
do
some
housework
but
most
of
the
time
I
am
a
person
sits
on
the
bed
or
on
the
wheelchair
When
I
was
home
to
sit
to
uncle
home
to
flow
because
the
uncle's
path
is
the
only
way
which
must
be
passed
on
the
junior
high
school
so
when
the
school
in
the
school
I'll
be
watching
them
back
and
forth
it
seems
that
I'm
reading
way

not
give
up
Father
borrow
money
did
not
come
back
but
the
family
tattle
and
prate
much

when

my
ears
ago
often
nag
daddy
thing
I
feel
creepy
why
is
it
so
Dad

Dad
You

back
You

back
quickly
I
prefer
not
to
read
will
not
let
you
be
such
grievances
such
insults
Dad
Dad
What
are
you
Why
are
they
so
say
you
I
have
been
to
have
been
waiting
for
his
return
Aunt
said
your
father
too
do
bad
name
that
he
do
it
really
lost
your
face
For
a
start
I
don't
know
what
happened
the
mood
is
very
heavy
asked
aunt
how
Is
there
anything
so
so
serious
Aunt
aggravated
by
an
angry
tone
said
your
father
outside
in
order
to
give
you
borrow
books
first
to
your
aunt's
house
he
said
the
home
to
buy
cattle
need
to
borrow
money
so
aunt
to
know
no
such
thing
so
don't
borrow
To
the
ancient
city
of
leaf
Tingjia
your
father's
friends
said
to
buy
chemical
fertilizer
to
borrow
a
little
money
Tingjia
leaves
no
he
will
go
to
your
grandma's
house
to
you
two
uncle's
house
to
borrow
your
dad
said
is
to
build
a
house
your
uncle
happened
to
encounter
village
grow
there
ask
he
once
topic
was
exposed
he
had
to
go
to
Ningbo
and
the
town
of
Evergreen
s
aunt
s
home
to
borrow
they
have
had
to
go
to
Shangjie
discussed
In
fact
I
was
really
want
to
ask
why
he
did
know
go
to
Ningbo
to
evergreen
all
be
crystal
clear
isn't
he
is
immortal
But
I
think
if
I
really
ask
those
words
do
not
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
again
I
heard
a
few
times
she
simply
said
you
don't
read
simply
go
out
work
I
thought
if
Dad
comes
back
I
can't
read
but
sometimes
I
am
unwilling
heart
no
matter
what
was
advised
in
the
school
I
had
a
few
lessons
can
comfort
my
soul
As
for
the
aunt's
words
I
don't
want
to
hear
but
also
do
not
want
to
use
it
The
school
school
for
several
days
Dad
Don't
see
at
that
time
I
was
a
little
worried
but
those
tattle
and
prate
is
not
stopped
but
also
the
diffusion
constant
at
While
I
thought
in
my
mind
my
father
come
back
and
side
wanted
dad
to
lend
money
to
come
back
I
can
take
a
good
read
I
do
not
want
to
give
up
all
of
a
sudden
but
to
no
avail
since
the
tattle
and
prate
my
heart
was
tortured
to
death
Mom
In
addition
to
complaining
that
father
outside
sometimes
also
want
to
talk
to
scold
me
maybe
she
more
recently
than
I
was
upset
so
she
wants
to
say
I
she
said
to
me
and
I
don't
chew
sound
One
day
I
went
to
his
aunt's
house
because
the
boring
to
my
aunt's
house
behind
the
bamboo
inside
to
digging
up
bamboo
shoots
when
I
really
dig
vigorously
suddenly
heard
the
mother's
cry
I
came
down
to
see
his
aunt
said
Daddy
things
let
s
lose
face
so
my
mother
sometimes
hard
to
explain
for
oneself
sometimes
feel
helpless
because
she
feels
she
jumped
into
the
the
Yellow
River
wash
not
clear
so
she
felt
wronged
cry
In
fact
say
mother
instigated
is
possible
the
key
is
my
own
request
forcing
the
father
in
the
back
of
the
eternal
infamy
to
say
in
the
final
analysis
is
my
fault
so
I
ought
to
I
heard
my
mother
weeping
I
also
feel
very
sad
This
a
few
days
later
mother's
mood
has
not
been
good
if
not
more
I
see
my
mother
like
this
is
very
worried
After
a
few
days
of
school
another
week
has
passed
I
also
miss
dad
Don't
know
Dad
outside
doing
may
be
I
worry
most
X
x
on
the
evening
the
sun
nearly
down
hill
Dad
came
back
I
go
first
call
dad
like
my
father
and
several
years
not
to
meet
such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
say
uncle
s
contribution
but
not
all
because
I
have
three
hundred
yuan
to
make
books
uncle
didn't
go
with
me
in
the
said
dad
before
he
has
not
called
me
to
junior
high
school
but
a
three
again
three
advised
me
to
give
up
reading
now
papa
got
money
made
a
part
of
my
books
I
read
to
say
to
their
credit
is
a
little
exaggerated
Father
left
home
also
no
rest
was
mother
shouted
did
mother's
grievance
venting
gas
while
the
father
was
annoyed
do
not
know
to
whom
to
tell
he

Mother
said

The

you
to
cheat

Oh
So

people

begging
Dad
shouted
who
said
that
To
who
said
that
You
give
me
a
call
My
accusers
Mother
said
without
confrontation
the
village
has
spread
to
open
You

the
village

make
inquiries

know
You're
so

to
them

Dad
said
Mother
said
your
sister-in-law
also
said
do
not
believe
you
can
go
and
ask
him
do
their
own
things
to
know
Later
my
father
also
do
not
know
to
have
to
confront
this
thing
Buleerle
But
the
father
and
mother
are
very
long
time
had
not
spoken
always
keep
silence
state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
very
so
stay
at
home
for
too
long
you
feel
so
lonely
and
boring
parents
also
I
have
no
job
but
feel
puzzled
think
it
over
and
over
again
had
no
friends
who
can
help
me
introduce
then
find
the
parents
remember
my
cousin

Although
the
city
as
it
is
my
most
beautiful
dream
also
is
I
most
look
forward
to
come
to
one
of
the
city
but
because

economically
not
rich
or
because
I
was
in
the
city
without

until

I
first
came
to
the

Since

very
next
day
morning
speeding
and
returned
to
his
hometown
urged
me
to
go
to
the
city
to
do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or
promises
probably
at
that
time
I
have
been
in
the
dream
of
the
life
in

city
there's
nothing
to
refuse

while

told
me
A
Cheng

to
your
cousin's
arrangement
don't
go
out
on
a
night
out
that
will
make
your
brother
worry
will
let
us
worry
there
is
the
question
of
your
life
must
be
well
orderly
and
you
wear
and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother
and
friends
will
look
down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said
you
know
now
but
really
to
the
city
after
you
is
it
right
Our
words
as
unheeded
advice
that
an
inlet
and
an
outlet
to
forget
about
and
do
I
hope
you
not
if
you
so
dad
wouldn't
want
to
control
you
The
night
his
father
for
the
first
time
to
drink
is
also
the
first
time
that
I
drank
tincture
MOET
drunk
I
in
the
night
imperceptibly
in
wheezing
to
sleep
Early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
I
also
in
outdoor
breathe
fresh
air
waiting
for
mother
made
breakfast
eat
a
good
meal
with
my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also
can
Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or
accept
it
D's
said
rest
assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her
I
will
give
him
his
money
saved
in
the
home
My
father
put
the
money
back
pocket
looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
that
here
was
the
last
miss
that
my
heart
is
full
of
hope
full
of
ideals
is
my
nostalgia
reminds
me
of
the
beauty
of
my
hometown
As
tears
like
springs
that
my
surging
mood
as
in
heaven
so
here
swear
resolutely
obey
D's
command
I
went
to
Lake
source
direction
to
horse
sword
shift
car
went
straight
to
the
F
town
Go
forward
with
great
strength
and
vigour
to
the
F
city
F
City
we
in
the
long-distance
passenger
station
of
the
car
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
city
I
think
it's
great
it
is
because
I
first
saw
the
perfect
city
probably
for
the
city
people
the
city
is
not
big
because
there
are
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
such
as
Shanghai
Hangzhou
Nanjing
are
so
But
I
look
I
see
it
is
because
I
have
no
contact
with
the
city
and
the
first
contact
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
novelty
I
felt
that
here
is
my
dream
of
heaven
D
s
first
got
out
of
the
car
I
have
to
get
off
the
streets
together
with
him
I
don't
know
what
this
is
what
Lane
Road
always
feel
in
the
alley
as
in
gossip
so
I
feel
I
can't
touch
the
North
East
and
touched
the
East
has
touched
the
north
deeply
he
was
puzzled
When
I
came
to
a
river
river
sides
erected
a
high-rise
blocks
I
always
thought
that
this
is
the
Fuchun
River
I
really
think
you
saw
the
Fuchun
River
I
was
a
sigh
and
said
the
Fuchun
River
does
not
have
such
a
river
I
didn't
necessarily
it
big
D's
said
this
is
not
the
Fuchun
River
but
an
amaranth
Pujiang
I
said
oh
It
is
my
illusion
Words
I
am
his
behind
but
when
we
are
at
the
crossroads
in
the
middle
turn
right
this
is
a
long
hill
road
Liuzhou
Road
building
is
bristly
and
let
me
feel
the
perfect
city
economy
is
thriving
and
prosperous
each
poineering
hardships
may
make
it
difficult
to
imagine
as
I
came
to
a
world
came
to
a
childhood
paradise
I
see
a
paradise
of
dream
in
my
nose
to
dazzle
along
the
road
of
hill
of
dragon
of
the
past
it
is
a
city
surrounded
by
people
in
and
out
of
the
mall
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
in
the
commercial
city
upstairs
to
write
the
Fuchun
River
commercial
city
it
seems
like
I
know
this
is
F
the
city's
most
bustling
shopping
center
the
most
bustling
sidewalks
I
just
want
to
say
the
city
of
F
F
really
great
I
came
to
this
strange
city
I
really
feel
in
this
strange
city
I
can
absorb
your
sunny
temperament
to
be
a
city
that
the
giants
I
am
going
to
show
themselves
When
I
didn't
see
enough
outside
downtown
scene
I
was
D's
to
the
commercial
city
there
are
all
the
stalls
food
stands
above
the
green
vegetables
eggplant
garlic
onion
bean
curd
a
kind
sister
church
where
D's
stall
led
me
here
and
sister
chatted
a
while
when
the
elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
is
to
eat
lunch
saw
us
big
brother
put
down
his
chopsticks
call
us
to
sit
down
then
O
O
said
A
Cheng
Your
dinner
have
you
had
dinner
yet
I
haven't
answered
D's
for
I
said
we
have
no
Big
brother
says
here
to
eat
not
home
to
burn
She
also
said
yes
Or
here
to
eat
even
home
to
burn
much
trouble
D's
said
not
so
polite
home
to
burn
it
it
didn't
take
long
very
fast
He
made
the
remarks
at
the
same
time
I
still
look
around
because
I
see
here
is
such
a
big
stall
is
also
the
first
time
saw
so
many
dishes
people
buy
vegetable
stall
So
my
curiosity
in
here
is
not
fun
When
I
put
the
spirit
are
concentrated
in
the
food
stalls
of
things
he
finished
on
the
go
I'm
still
hazy
a
bit
at
a
loss
situation
he
said
to
me
A
Cheng
we
go
I
didn't
hear
there
is
one
point
be
absent-minded
look
he
coaxed
out
of
said
hello
What's
on
your
mind
Told
you
so
loudly
did
not
hear
Go
I
said
oh
Elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
to
pick
some
fresh
vegetables
let
you
bring
us
back
to
cook
he
and
I
left
sister
they
couple
booth
then
to
another
butcher
shop
stall
bought
several
kilograms
of
meat
left
the
commercial
city
and
imperceptibly
and
through
a
Malaysian
Road
came
to
a
named
Zhou
Jianong
lane
across
the
alley
alley
went
to
D's
house
D's
house
is
an
underground
garage
inside
a
very
the
smell
is
also
important
I
very
want
to
move
out
but
I
will
not
economic
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
environment
here
it
is
the
parents
of
thousand
exhort
enjoin
let
I
firmly
remember
them
you
want
me
to
listen
to
D's
so
I
had
to
reluctantly
stay
When
I
walked
inside
the
heat
from
the
outside
directly
to
heaven
so
I
really
feel
it's
hard
I
am
afraid
went
into
the
furnace
of
the
house
let
me
really
angry
be
ashamed
of
dying
When
I
was
in
the
hot
sun
dried
by
the
sun
at
the
same
time
D's
said
why
don't
you
come
in
Quickly
Wash
dishes
I
went
to
go
say
to
him
it
is
too
hot
I
have
a
bit
of
a
bear
D's
continued
hot
A
fan
Do
not
be
afraid
of
heat
a
long
time
to
get
over
I
come
too
but
we
insist
on
the
stand
A
man
should
be
afraid
of
tired
we
are
so
out
of
practice
I
said
oh
Came
to
give
him
food
finished
lunch
he's
out
let
me
have
a
rest
at
home
for
a
day
starting
tomorrow
I
promised
D's
a
boring
also
have
a
look
at
the
room
television
occasionally
to
bring
home
the
story
books
doubled
the
old
warm
up
in
primary
and
secondary
schools
the
residual
reading
difficulty
One
day
in
the
imperceptibly
in
the
past
soon
arrived
at
dusk
D's
also
returned
to
cook
I
don't
know
how
to
cook
so
there
are
a
lot
of
housework
is
D's
one
person
to
complete
I
can
only
one
wash
dishes
clean
the
room
health
or
what
other
are
not
good
At
night
after
dinner
D's
and
I
had
to
watch
TV
in
bed
TV
also
is
no
good
program
I
watched
a
imperceptibly
fell
asleep
Suddenly
I
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
I
will
readily
but
here
I
can
not
find
the
toilet
was
anxious
to
panic
I
find
that
I
finally
find
convenient
corner
when
I
finished
returned
was
a
patrol
car
through
here
I
was
found
by
police
as
a
thief
was
caught
The
car
out
of
the
two
patrol
to
check
my
ID
card
I
came
to
the
interior
from
my
bag
show
identity
cards
to
give
them
they
took
out
the
register
put
my
name
and
identity
card
number
is
recorded
in
it
and
again
and
again
I
ask
my
family
and
address
then
they
contact
D
s
asked
his
identity
asked
his
work
address
information
is
very
detailed
and
they
have
put
D
s
identity
as
a
pledge
export
to
a
television
set
let
him
leave
the
TV
invoice
and
specifications
to
verify
can
put
his
things
he
returned
to
the
He
had
to
accept
to
let
them
D's
until
the
patrol
had
gone
he
said
how
can
you
not
carefully
let
the
guard
discovered
I
said
I
don't
know
How
do
I
know
the
night
police
so
fiercely
knew
that
I
wouldn't
back
out
D's
continued
next
to
a
sharp
point
don't
be
so
idiotic
Know
or
not
Said
oh
Know
Put
out
the
light
then
we
sleep
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
sleep
at
night
because
the
room
was
at
night
is
also
very
difficult
to
eliminate
unless
the
outside
temperature
drops
to
the
upper
20s
degrees
after
midnight
there
may
be
more
comfortable
Wake
up
the
first
thing
I
do
is
to
wash
brush
work
then
I
put
a
few
of
the
ash
bucket
and
a
large
shovels
and
in
D
s
back
leading
me
to
play
first
In
fact
I
don't
know
what
is
hard
what
is
helpless
life
I
have
not
try
at
home
parents
regard
me
as
a
saint
as
for
at
that
time
I
feel
so
blessed
and
now
I
can
only
obey
D's
leadership
as
his
apprentice
I
came
to
the
city
gates
then
turn
to
the
Old
Road
South
Gate
Street
South
Gate
Street
rely
on
the
Fuchun
River
and
that
a
large
river
it
is
the
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
we
stand
position
is
the
Fuchun
River
ferry
terminal
just
because
it
is
against
the
direction
of
the
city
to
the
South
so
it
means
draw
road
also
known
as
South
Gate
Street
near
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
I
came
here
did
not
look
at
the
moon
not
here
on
vacation
trip
or
something
I
was
just
a
young
worker
come
to
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
many-storied
buildings
work
most
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
river
I
and
it
are
not
fate
I
climbed
to
the
six
floor
of
this
building
opened
the
door
there
are
several
woodworking
early
start
working
here
their
decoration
process
of
half
I
come
here
only
a
toilet
and
a
wing
not
paved
tiles
This
is
D
s
and
I
started
to
do
it
My
first
day
at
work
is
to
carry
cement
bag
or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too
much
I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
is
D
s
wake
me
from
this
dream
urged
me
to
go
to
work
I
mistily
mistily
to
get
up
go
to
work
work
on
the
path
of
two
feet
in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a
little
be
petrified
like
How
can
I
not
to
mention
the
spirit
Seems
to
me
the
wholeEven
if
more
magnificent
rhetoric
Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk
the
voice
Beat
the
floor
Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me
babble
learn
language
I
learned
to
language
in
the
river
The
first
word-mom
How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only
for
repel
mosquitoes
Breeze
send
me
to
sleep
But
regardless
of
the
eyebrows
climb
sweat
poured
Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite
write
of
word
Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
and
vertical
dignified
and
imposing
You
said
that
a
man
have
to
like
it
Young
i
was
not
sensible
Occasionally
make
a
mistake
You
taught
me
the
force
of
justice
I
keep
in
mind
your
word
Dare
not
have
a
bit
slight
In
order
to
build
a
quiet
environment
for
my
studies
The
already
heavy
burden
of
the
family
You
take
on
all
the
housework
and
farm
work
Even
if
was
too
tired
to
take
a
breath
Also
won't
let
me
take
part
in
I
was
moved
to
nothing
to
say
In
my
memory
You've
never
luxury
one
coin
You
let
me
know
what
is
bitter
What
is
sweet
In
your
reference
I
have
learned
to
pinch
and
scrape
On
the

Several
times

Youth
at
a
loss
You
listen
to
me
dribs
and
drabs
And
give
me
all
of
the
analysis
and
directions
I
like
the
blind
man
to
regain
the
light
when
injustice
and
resentment
All
the
world
don't
understand
me
Only
you
know
me
In
you
here
I
got
the
light
when
faced
with
the
choices
I
hesitate
to
stray
around
You
give
me
advice¡¢contrast
But
you
won¡¯t

long
As
it
was
she
knew
I
was
a
very
insecure
afraid
to
lose
even
if
there
is
no
important
will
also
write
a
long
message
let
me
know
her
by
my
side
never
leave
Chen
is
a
very
clever
girl
but
in
the
study
does
not
enlighten
after
each
test
there
will
always
be
that
her
poor
grades
in
my
front
side
into
my
mouth
ice
cream
a
begged
me
to
help
her
with
We
have
been
together
for
9
years
so
only
a
piece
of
memory
I
always
thought
she
was
a
bright
child
happy
and
simple
life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
From
the
bright
sunlight
If
the
rain
from
the
cloud
Break
your
pride
Think
of
my
love
for
you
And
everything
shall
be
fine
Let
us
soar
let
us
fly
To
the
highest
height
And
everything
shall
be
fineLast
year
the
cancer
nearly
finished
me
off
However
with
the
accompaniment
of
my
best
friend
Candice
I
could
eventually
get
through
these
tough
time
Sometimes
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
always
stand
by
my
side
Last
summer
the
doctor
discovered
that
I
suffered
from
lung
cancer
At
that
moment
I
was
completely
shocked
All
memories
that
I
have
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
in
seconds
I
thought
I
was
going
to
leave
all
my
friends
my
family
and
all
people
I
loved
To
me
the
whole
world
was
just
sinking
Luckily
that
was
just
in
an
early
stage
and
the
doctor
said
that
I
had
I
great
chance
to
recover
after
a
series
of
treatments
But
he
warned
me
that
the
treatment
would
be
very
tough
and
painful
At
first
I
have
considered
to
refuse
the
treatment
However
after
I
have
though
about
all
of
my
valuable
friends
and
my
mom
and
dad
I
chose
to
take
the
chance
During
the
treatment
I
gradually
suffered
from
the
side
effects
The
number
of
hairs
on
my
head
declined
and
I
vomited
from
dawn
till
night
on
every
single
day
I
had
a
very
poor
appetite
and
I
nearly
had
no
desired
to
put
any
food
to
my
mouth
I
was
very
painful
and
I
was
thinking
about
giving
up
the
treatment
I
though
I
could
not
tolerate
it
anymore
However
with
the
support
and
encouragement
from
my
best
friend
Candice
I
have
eventually
made
it
through
the
rain
and
stand
up
once
again
Finally
I
recovered
One
summer
night
Candice
came
to
the
hospital
to
visit
me
We
sat
on
the
bench
that
facing
the
sea
The
sun
was
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
night
descended
We
chatted
underneath
the
stars
We
have
not
met
each
other
since
the
graduation
Candice
said
with
tears
on
her
face
Yes
I
have
never
thought
we
would
have
the
reunion
in
the
situation
I
said
She
kept
silent
with
her
tears
in
the
warm
gentle
breeze
We
have
been
best
friends
since
we
were
small
I
do
not
want
this
friendship
to
end
up
so
soon
She
cried
desperately
Zach
you
are
a
man
You
are
a
man
who
is
courageous
and
adventurous
You
should
have
that
guts
to
fight
for
your
life
and
people
around
you
But
Now
I
am
going
to
give
you
the
courage
you
need
She
lay
her
hand
on
me
Lord
please
give
this
little
boy
love
and
hope
to
face
the
obstacle
that
he
is
now
facing
Please
give
him
courage
to
help
him
to
find
the
way
Now
you
have
already
possessed
the
ability
to
fight
this
war
You
should
never
give
up
as
there
is
a
light
in
your
heart
and
shines
very
brightly
Since
them
I
understand
that
when
fate
is
tough
just
toughen
your
faith
With
a
smile
I
know
I
could
face
the
future
no
matter
what
lay
ahead
And
there's
a
hero
comes
along
with
the
strength
to
carry
on
My
dad
has
always
used
this
song
to
encourage
me
Until
he
passed
away
I
still
keep
this
song
in
my
iPod
and
listen
to
it
when
I
need
to
get
through
some
tough
time
To
me
this
song
does
not
only
symbolize
the
spirit
of
my
dad
but
also
mine
This
song
is
ubiquitous
in
various
singing
competitions
Regardless
of
its
singing
technique
the
beautiful
melody
and
those
meaningful
lyrics
has
helped
many
people
to
get
through
obstacles
This
fabulous
song
was
composed
by
American
singer-songwriter
Mariah
Carey
in
1993
and
definitely
performed
by
herself
The
song
mentioned
that
among
every
single
one
of
us
a
hero
lies
inside
our
heart
If
we
try
to
reach
into
our
soul
our
emptiness
will
disappear
There's
a
hero
if
you
look
inside
your
heart
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid
of
who
you
are
When
I
was
small
I
was
a
child
who
was
so
fragile
and
cried
easily
I
was
afraid
of
everything
I
was
so
this
and
small
and
when
my
classmates
bullied
me
all
I
would
do
was
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
and
cry
from
dawn
till
night
Worse
still
I
was
poor
in
academic
result
and
no
teachers
loved
me
On
these
days
I
found
myself
useless
and
believed
that
no
one
in
this
world
would
recognise
this
small
potato
I
was
so
desperate
Yet
in
one
dark
night
my
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
hand
was
so
large
and
warm
All
I
could
feel
was
the
love
and
hope
transmitted
through
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
and
to
my
heart
and
soul
Son
you
should
not
be
fragile
anymore
But
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
Now
I
am
going
to
recall
your
hero
from
your
soul
and
from
now
on
you
would
never
feel
lonely
anymore
My
hero
and
your
hero
have
already
stayed
together
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
Other
people
can
say
anything
they
want
to
say
Although
they
try
to
bring
you
down
you
will
never
allow
them
to
do
so
because
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
This
hero
will
always
stay
close
to
you
and
protect
you
forever
Afterwards
he
sang
this
song
to
me
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow
But
don't
let
anyone
to
tear
them
away
Since
then
whenever
I
need
to
face
any
problems
or
obstacles
alone
I
will
not
be
fragile
anymore
All
I
need
to
do
is
sing
Hero
along
with
my
hero
and
my
father's
hero
and
I
will
certainly
know
that
my
father
will
guide
me
where
I
should
go
I
know
that
there
is
a
light
in
me
and
shines
very
brightly
and
other
people
can
try
but
they
can
never
take
that
away
from
me
The
meeting
is
WangHai
Time
always
unknowingly
hurried
away
flash
Also
in
the
online
to
spend
a
few
years
Cry
also
laughed
Thousands
of
day
and
night
WangHai
roaming
A
thought
to
mature
Walk
to
the
friend
go
to
How
many
friends
already
not
disappear
Sitting
alone
in
the
space
is
cold
and
cheerless
Some
vague
sad
loss
Thankfully
Have
a
lot
of
friends
have
been
silent
about
Accompany
me
along
the
way
Always
buchibuqi
In
the
virtual
network
Deduce
true
feelings
Behind
the
screen
in
the
cold
And
each
wish
Whenever
the
birthday
Will
receive
blessings
of
friends
Very
often
I
moved
ShiXi
unceasingly
Thanks

and

Because
of
you
Lonely
night
has
not
lonely
Because
of
you
My
birthday
is
not
cold
and
cheerless
Of
a
friend
said
I
am
not
alone
My
friend
Thousands
of
WanLiLi
just
a
moment
of
distance
Don't
need

also
need
not

Both
you
and
I

to
pay
tribute
and
show
appreciation
to

person
called
mom

may
not
say
it
openly
to
their
mother
There's
no
substitute
for
her
Cherish
every
single
moment
Though
at
times
she
may
not
be
the
best
of
friends
may
not
agree
to
our
thoughts
she
is
still
your
mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left

essayist
and
historian
During

became
one

On

Carlyle
married
his
secretary
Jane
Welsh
She
was
an
intelligent
attractive
and
somewhat
temperamental
daughter
of
a
well-to-do
doctor
They
had
their
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
but
still
loved
Bathroom
Vanities
each
other
dearly
After
their
marriage
Jane
continued
to
serve
as
his
secretary
But
after
several
years
of
marriage
Jane
became
ill
Being
Bathroom
Mirrors
a
hard
worker
Carlyle
became
so
absorbed
in
his
writings
that
he
let
Jane
continue
working
for
several
weeks
after
she
became
ill
She
had
cancer
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
slow
growing
kind
she
finally
became
confined
to
her
bed
Although
Carlyle
loved
her
Bathroom
Accessories
dearly
he
very
seldom
found
time
to
stay
with
her
long
He
was
busy
with
his
work
when
Jane
died
they
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
for
the
service
The
day
Glass
Basin
was
a
miserable
day
It
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
Following
the
funeral
Carlyle
went
back
to
his
home
He
was
taking
it
pretty
hard
He
went
up
the
stairs
to
Jane's
room
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
her
bed
He
sat
there
thinking
Shower
Enclosures
about
how
little
time
he
had
spent
with
her
and
wishing
so
much
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
differently
Noticing
her
diary
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
picked
it
up
and
began
to
steel
shelving
read
it
Suddenly
he
seemed
shocked
He
saw
it
There
on
one
page
she
had
written
Interior
Doors
a
single
line
Yesterday
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
and
it
was
like
heaven
I
love
him
so
Something
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
He
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
that
he
meant
so
much
to
her
He
thought
of
all
wow
gold
australia
the
times
he
had
gone
about
his
work
without
thinking
about
and
noticing
her
Then
Carlyle
turned
the
page
in
the
diary
There
he
noticed
she
racking
had
written
some
words
that
broke
his
heart
I
have
listened
all
day
to
hear
his
steps
in
the
hall
but
now
it
is
late
and
I
guess
he
won't
come
today
Carlyle
read
a
little
more
in
the
book
Then
he
threw
it
down
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Some
of
his
friends
found
him
at
the
grave
his
buy
wow
gold
australia
face
buried
in
the
mud
His
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
Tears
continued
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
He
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
If
I
had
only
known
if
I
had
only
known
But
it
was
too
late
for
Carlyle
She
was
dead
After
Jane's
death
Carlyle
made
world
of
warcraft
gold
for
sale
little
attempt
to
write
again
The
historians
say
he
lived
another
15
years
weary
bored
and
a
partial
recluse
I
share
the
story
with
in
the
hope
that
you
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
While
our
loved
ones
must
have
the
money
we
make
to
live
it
is
the
love
we
have
that
they
really
want
Give
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
It
is
not
easy
to
define
what
kind
of
meaning
to
the
enterprise
culture
because
the
enterpise
culture
stems
from
the
ration
and
reality
which
should
be
related
to
the
regulations
or
how
to
react
to
the
risk
of
management
or
market
instead
of
just
focusing
on
training
and
meeting
which
should
be
related
to
the
proportion
of
thoughts
of
belonging
to
our
company
and
benefitting
our
company
in
the
difficulty
Sometimes
the
puzzled
people
are
always
in
the
mess
of
understanding
of
why
the
itemized
regulations
could
not
optimize
the
operation
and
not
regulate
the
action
of
some
officials
who
always
abused
the
power
to
benefit
themselves
which
lead
to
the
argument
that
as
long
as
the
company
is
so
large
that
the
culture
of
enterprise
is
absolutly
difficult
to
be
built
up
Different
people
with
different
education
background
and
different
comprehension
of
society
would
not
be
integrated
to
the
common
recognition
of
enterprise
culture
which
is
the
crux
to
help
the
company
be
prosperous
In
spite
of
training
many
officials
there
are
lots
of
bottlenecks
which
should
be
smoothed
and
holes
which
should
be
covered
so
we
must
work
out
some
measures
to
make
our
company
step
on
the
right
road
Regulations
are
parts
of
the
enterprise
culture
making
the
road
straight
but
what
kind
of
regulations
are
suitful
to
the
state-owned
company
The
regulation
are
always
eroded
by
dereliction
and
are
not
always
strickly
implemented
by
some
departments
Frankly
speaking
the
enterprise
culture
is
just
having
some
aspects
in
consciousness
frequently
dominating
the
behavior
which
would
give
us
some
reference
on
how
to
enact
the
detailed
regulations
could
get
the
return
as
expected
The
most
important
thing
related
to
the
enterprise
culture
is
how
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
in
the
every
respect
of
operation
We
must
detail
every
process
of
how
to
control
the
cost
and
how
to
make
the
work
efficient
and
rational
If
employee
could
make
their
regulations
rooted
in
mind
they
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
keep
them
from
dereliction
and
would
try
their
best
to
devote
the
wisdom
to
benifitting
our
company.For
example
The
flaws
in
human
nature
and
the
shortage
of
wealth
would
seduce
the
officals
to
accept
the
secret
money
from
agencies
who
are
intended
to
pull
down
the
officals
by
all
kinds
of
tactics
and
if
the
officals
are
too
fragile
to
resist
the
gifts
they
would
be
united
with
agencies
to
cheat
our
company
so
the
task
which
brooks
no
delay
is
the
education
brainwashing
and
making
the
severe
punishment
happen
without
them
the
enterprise
culture
is
like
the
moon
in
water
like
the
flowers
in
mist
like
the
stupid
being
called
clever
What
is
the
quintessence
of
the
enterprise
culture
It
is
easy
or
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
conclusion
because
it
is
a
hard
job
to
change
people¡¯s
mindset
which
is
always
in
the
prejustice.So
at
first
we
must
scrutinize
the
origin
of
the
prejustice
why
are
so
many
people
always
just
negating
others
because
we
are
extremely
lack
of
communication
to
understand
with
each
other
lacking
of
wisdom
to
tell
the
right
and
the
wrong
lacking
of
the
wide
chest
to
tolerate
the
different
ideas
wnich
lead
to
misunderstand
among
people
and
to
form
the
impasse
to
flexibly
resolve
the
thorny
problem.There
are
some
words
similar
and
implicated
with
the
word
culture
in
dictionary
such
as
communication
concoct
cooperation
coordination
copartner
control¡±
giving
us
some
metaphor
or
euphemism
that
enterprise
culture
must
depend
on
the
communication
cooperation
must
control
the
ridiculous
behavior
of
some
officials
must
concoct
the
atmosphere
from
stiff
suffocated
environment
to
the
active
creative
philosophical
philanthropic
state
of
mindset
of
everyone.But
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
behavior
spontaneously
follow
the
bright
side
of
human
being
just
because
of
the
fragile
and
selfish
nature
of
people
with
some
ignorant
knowledge
about
themselves
so
using
the
regulations
to
control
the
devil
in
their
mindset
and
encouraging
the
bold
attitude
to
resolve
the
present
and
history
problem
is
the
essential
way
of
making
the
enterprise
culture
alive
and
giving
the
light
to
the
employee
We
must
change
the
thoughts
that
we
are
isolated
by
others
we
are
just
living
for
ourself
we
are
just
focusing
on
our
private
cases
to
the
thoughts
that
if
we
can
help
each
other
if
we
believe
in
the
philosophy
of
strengthenning
the
consciousness
of
doing
the
job
positively
and
wisely
getting
good
return
we
can
achieve
the
goal
of
making
our
company
profitful
and
competitive
even
making
our
life
happy
Why
are
the
employee
always
having
no
enthusiasm
and
lacking
of
a
little
responsibility
in
their
job?why
are
there
lots
of
complaint
in
our
company?why
are
the
talented
people
resigning
quickly
from
our
company?Yes
the
salary
is
the
key
and
having
no
feeling
in
cooperation
unity
belonging
and
having
not
the
promising
future
are
the
fundamental
reasons
which
steamrollerred
the
spirit
to
be
loyal
to
company
so
putting
the
importance
of
employee
in
priority
is
the
way
of
having
the
high
competition
in
this
globallized
world
A
healthy
company
is
the
one
that
urgently
need
the
creative
advices
from
employee
in
stead
of
closing
their
eyes
filling
in
their
ears
in
front
of
the
employee
who
may
have
some
profound
and
pragmatic
ideas
which
maybe
benifit
to
the
operation
of
our
company.But
how
to
distinguish
the
good
ideas
or
the
wrong
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
leaders
who
must
look
through
everything
including
themselves
and
others
adding
that
they
must
comprehend
the
logic
of
mindset
and
behavior
of
themself
To
be
leaders
the
open
attitude
is
the
good
way
to
rationalize
the
management
adopting
the
positive
way
to
eliminate
the
flaws
in
the
structure
and
to
attain
the
goal
with
attacking
the
black
hands¡±
instead
of
always
being
in
defensive
measure
of
healing
the
fissure
in
management
that
is
deficient
in
courage
and
wisdom.It
is
also
one
part
of
the
enterprise
culture.Frankly
saying
having
good
return
to
our
company
is
dominated
by
the
fate
by
the
hearts
of
all
employee
by
the
regulations
by
the
rational
philosophy
by
the
authentic
wisdom
Service
is
the
culture
it
sounds
like
simple
but
complicated
and
profound
if
you
want
to
make
it
better
and
better
How
to
do
service
is
the
important
culture
of
enterprise
which
could
attract
many
people
to
take
our
flights
again
and
again.We
can
ask
a
simple
question
that
if
you
look
up
to
see
the
twinkled
stars
in
night
what
make
you
comfortable?The
answer
is
easy
the
bright
the
color
make
you
feel
comfortable
which
can
make
us
have
some
comprehension
that
if
you
make
people¡¯s
body
such
as
eye
ear
limbs
nose
heart
feel
nice
your
service
is
the
nice
service
if
you
make
the
customers
angry
you
failed
in
doing
service.So
you
must
think
over
how
to
make
the
customers
feel
better
is
the
best
way
to
learn
how
to
give
service
to
these
arrogant
and
hypercritical
customers
Above
all
We
can
understand
that
if
you
have
regulations
in
your
mindset
which
sometimes
is
selfish
and
Out
of
my
window
the
darkness
gave
me
a
signal:if
you
are
habitted
in
the
darkness
of
heart
you
would
be
dissappionted
for
ever.sometimes
I
want
to
find
the
way
of
making
me
in
the
positive
attitude
to
the
life
but
always
are
beated
by
my
experiences
which
cutted
off
the
robe
attached
to
the
sunshine.but
the
frustrated
happenning
is
not
the
domination
which
converts
my
good
intention
to
the
devil
the
domination
is
my
thoughts
which
are
sometimes
not
superficial
but
profound
gives
me
the
light
and
warm
to
live
simply
and
happily
What
kind
of
thoughts
would
release
my
pressure
and
gives
me
the
ability
to
survive
in
the
chilly
and
choppy
reality
which
would
distort
the
heart
fragile
to
the
fragmentary
condition
or
make
the
heart
wisom
strong
get
the
meaning
of
life
which
would
push
me
to
the
heaven
with
lots
of
beauty
and
full
I
would
say
that
my
thoughts
is
related
to
the
thoughts
themselves
if
you
can
change
the
thoughts
quickly
and
correctedly
you
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
pusure
the
objects
you
want;if
you
are
stubborn
enough
you
would
be
easily
defeated
by
the
fate
which
urgently
need
the
wisdom
light
to
cover
the
black
in
the
mindset
full
of
good
and
evil
When
I
was
a
child
I
do
not
know
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
and
have
no
faith
which
would
comfort
my
soul
to
give
me
a
light
would
direct
my
road
to
the
tranquillized
home
My
pressure
is
from
my
family
where
my
father
is
not
a
reasonable
person
and
had
no
ideas
on
how
to
cultivate
my
individual
personality
and
my
character
so
in
the
long
time
I
felt
the
life
of
mine
is
in
hell
even
if
I
have
food
to
eat
have
cloth
to
wear
but
my
heart
was
in
deep
frustration
and
had
much
hatre
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
shaping
my
thoughts
that
the
life
had
not
power
to
lift
me
from
the
miserable
conditions.after
long
long
time
the
climate
has
been
changed
to
more
warm
the
rivers
have
been
changed
to
more
polluted
the
hearts
of
many
people
have
been
changed
by
desire
for
money
to
be
vicious
my
god
has
given
me
the
enlight
that
if
you
can
comprehend
the
love
the
truth
you
can
have
sheft
below
the
sunshine
which
would
fill
you
and
warm
you
so
it
is
my
fortunation
I
can
get
the
hints
from
god
giving
me
the
truth
which
fattened
my
twisted
raods
in
the
mist
and
I
can
smile
happily
and
never
be
frustrated
again
Even
if
I
explain
the
understanding
of
love
and
truth
again
and
again
lots
of
people
still
had
lof
of
question
on
my
comprehension
about
the
thoughts
as
same
as
my
past.in
my
past
I
was
puzzled
intensifiedly
on
some
meaningful
words.some
people
said
to
me
the
words
wisdom
but
it
is
like
a
fool
who
can
not
distinguish
what
is
right
or
wrong
I
am
delayed
to
understand
the
truth
which
stumbled
my
existence
and
made
me
fall
to
hell.but
the
darkness
is
not
always
having
no
light
maybe
my
god
has
pity
on
me
one
day
I
found
thoughts
can
change
my
action
my
attitude
to
the
life
I
confronted
that
is
in
the
embarrassed
condition.after
I
have
been
changed
to
the
peace
life
by
the
fresh
way
of
thinking
I
can
in
confidence
make
a
conclusion
that
please
believing
in
the
god¡¯s
soul
that
tell
you
what
is
yours
what
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
this
world
worthy
pusuring
you
should
love
should
dent
the
suffering
you
have
got
and
smiling
in
the
darkness
stubborn
and
everyone
would
follow
the
regulations
rooted
in
your
heart
thinking
of
the
company
as
your
own
our
enterprise
would
be
promising.The
safety
and
service
is
the
crux
to
our
enterprise
we
must
strengthen
our
consciousness
to
keep
them
in
our
mind
and
do
our
best
to
support
it
VIRTUE
is
like
a
rich
stone
best
plain
set
and
surely
virtue
is
best
in
a
body
that
is
comely
though
not
of
delicate
features
and
that
hath
rather
dignity
of
presence
than
beauty
of
aspect
Neither
is
it
almost
seen
that
very
beautiful
persons
are
otherwise
of
great
virtue
as
if
nature
were
rather
busy
not
to
err
than
in
labor
to
produce
excellency
And
therefore
they
prove
accomplished
but
not
of
great
spirit
and
study
rather
behavior
than
virtue
But
this
holds
not
always
for
Augustus
Caesar
Titus
Vespasianus
Philip
le
Belle
of
France
Edward
the
Fourth
of
England
Alcibiades
of
Athens
Ismael
the
Sophy
of
Persia
were
all
high
and
great
spirits
and
yet
the
most
beautiful
men
of
their
times
In
beauty
that
of
favor
is
more
than
that
of
color
and
that
of
decent
and
gracious
motion
more
than
that
of
favor
That
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
cannot
express
no
nor
the
first
sight
of
the
life
There
is
no
excellent
beauty
that
hath
not
some
strangeness
in
the
proportion
A
man
cannot
tell
whether
Apelles
or
Albert
Durer
were
the
more
trifler
whereof
the
one
would
make
a
personage
by
geometrical
proportions
the
other
by
taking
the
best
parts
out
of
divers
faces
to
make
one
excellent
Such
personages
I
think
would
please
nobody
but
the
painter
that
made
them
Not
but
I
think
a
painter
may
make
a
better
face
than
ever
was
but
he
must
do
it
by
a
kind
of
felicity
as
a
musician
that
maketh
an
excellent
air
in
music
and
not
by
rule
A
man
shall
see
faces
that
if
you
examine
them
part
by
part
you
shall
find
never
a
good
and
yet
altogether
do
well
If
it
be
true
that
the
principal
part
of
beauty
is
in
decent
motion
certainly
it
is
no
marvel
though
persons
in
years
seem
many
times
more
amiable
pulchrorum
autumnus
pulcher
for
no
youth
can
be
comely
but
by
pardon
and
considering
the
youth
as
to
make
up
the
comeliness
Beauty
is
as
summer
fruits
which
are
easy
to
corrupt
and
cannot
last
and
for
the
most
part
it
makes
a
dissolute
youth
and
an
age
a
little
out
of
countenance
but
yet
certainly
again
if
it
light
well
it
maketh
virtue
shine
and
vices
blush
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in

or
independence
With

children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World

a
father
seemed

god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling

to
do
and
know

that
no

Amazing

like
putting

back

just
like
that
Or
building

guiding

so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
It
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is

handshake

And

the

battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
again
until
it
was
firm
enough
As
time
passed
there
were
other
rules
to
learn
Always
do
your
best.""Do
it
now.""Never
lie
And
most
importantly
"You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
By
my
teens
he
wasn't
telling
me
what
to
do
anymore
which
was
scary
and
heady
at
the
same
time
He
provided
perspective
not
telling
me
what
was
around
the
great
corner
of
life
but
letting
me
know
there
was
a
lot
more
than
just
today
and
the
next
which
I
hadn't
thought
of
One
day
I
realize
now
there
was
a
change
I
wasn't
trying
to
please
him
so
much
as
I
was
trying
to
impress
him
I
never
asked
him
to
come
to
my
football
games
He
had
a
high-pressure
career
and
it
meant
driving
through
most
of
Friday
night
But
for
all
the
big
games
when
I
looked
over
at
the
sideline
there
was
that
familiar
fedora
And
by
God
did
the
opposing
team
captain
ever
get
a
firm
handshake
and
a
gaze
he
would
remember
Then
a
school
fact
contradicted
something
he
said
Impossible
that
he
could
be
wrong
but
there
it
was
in
the
book
These
accumulated
over
time
along
with
personal
experiences
to
buttress
my
own
developing
sense
of
values
And
I
could
tell
we
had
each
taken
our
own
perfectly
normal
paths
I
began
to
see
too
his
blind
spots
his
prejudices
and
his
weaknesses
I
never
threw
these
up
at
him
He
hadn't
to
me
and
anyway
he
seemed
to
need
protection
I
stopped
asking
his
advice
the
experiences
he
drew
from
no
longer
seemed
relevant
to
the
decisions
I
had
to
make
He
volunteered
advice
for
a
while
But
then
in
more
recent
years
politics
and
issues
gave
way
to
talk
of
empty
errands
and
always
to
ailments
From
his
bed
he
showed
me
the
many
sores
and
scars
on
his
misshapen
body
and
all
the
bottles
for
medicine
Sometimes
he
confided
I
would
just
like
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
not
wake
up
After
much
thought
and
practice
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
one
night
last
winter
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
and
remembered
for
an
instant
those
terrifying
dark
holes
in
another
house
35
years
before
I
told
my
fatherhow
much
I
loved
him
I
described
all
the
things
people
were
doing
for
him
But
I
said
he
kept
eating
poorly
hiding
in
his
room
and
violating
the
doctor's
orders
No
amount
of
love
could
make
someone
else
care
about
life
I
said
it
was
a
two-way
street
He
wasn't
doing
his
best
The
decision
was
his
He
said
he
knew
how
hard
my
words
had
been
to
say
and
how
proud
he
was
of
me
I
had
the
best
teacher
I
said
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
He
smiled
a
little
And
we
shook
hands
firmly
for
the
last
time
Several
days
later
at
about
4
A.M
my
mother
heard
Dad
shuffling
about
their
dark
room
I
have
some
things
I
have
to
do
he
said
He
paid
a
bundle
of
bills
He
composed
for
my
mother
a
long
list
of
legal
and
financial
what-to-do's
in
case
of
emergency
And
he
wrote
me
a
note
Then
he
walked
back
to
his
bed
and
laid
himself
down
He
went
to
sleep
naturally
And
he
did
not
wake
up
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial
Party
committees
have
created
detailed
policies
to
improve
their
working
style
as
required
by
the
country's
core
leadership
With
these
measures
Party
authorities
are
attempting
to
get
closer
to
the
public
experts
said
We
have
seen
lots
of
fresh
working
styles
from
the
newly
elected
Party
leaders
such
as
fewer
cliches
at
conferences
no
traffic
controls
during
inspection
tours

said
Zhu
Lijia
a
professor
of
public
administration
research
at
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Governance
But
Party
authorities
should
enhance
supervision
and
those
who
violate
regulations
should
be
punished

added
In

And
also
I

Michelle
Obama
who
said
their
grueling
campaign
schedules
made
them
two

And
the

And
that¡¯s
my

MOSCOW
Dec
26
Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans
on
U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against
Russians
abroad
and
persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset
freezes
on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take
effect
on
Jan
1
2013
if
signed
by
the
president
into
law
Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov
told
local
media
Wednesday
that
Putin
would
consider
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
within
two
weeks
after
the
Federation
Council
approved
it
The
State
Duma
or
lower
house
of
the
parliament
on
Friday
passed
the
bill
with
420
parliamentarians
voting
yes
seven
voting
against
and
one
abstaining
However
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
was
not
supported
by
all
the
Russians
On
Wednesday
the
Moscow
police
have
detained
four
people
near
the
Federation
Council
building
who
were
protesting
against
the
bill
Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of
rights
was
signed
in
November
1989
All
member
states
are
obliged
to
develop
and
undertake
all
actions
and
policies
in
the
light
of
the
best
interests
of
a
child
Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
Users
shall
be
responsible
for
reclaiming
the
same
area
and
quality
of
cultivated
land
they
use
for
construction
of

Wang

an

Standing

voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of

and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State

conduct

Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive

construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82

2011
figures
from
the
report

The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in
November
imposing
visa
bans
and
asset

on
Russian
officials
thought
responsible
for
the
death
of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in
2009
in
a
Moscow
jail
after
accusing
officials
of
tax
fraud
The
Russian
lawmakers
voted
unanimously
for
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
or
the
Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S
citizens
from
adopting
Russian
orphans
and
acting
as
intermediaries
in
that
sphere
The
bill
is
named
after
Dima
Yakovlev
a
Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his
foster
parents
negligence
According
to
the
Russian
process
the
bill
will
be
submitted
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
for
signing
It
would
take
effect
on
Jan
1
2013
if
signed
by
the
president
into
law
Kremlin
spokesman
Dmitry
Peskov
told
local
media
Wednesday
that
Putin
would
consider
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
within
two
weeks
after
the
Federation
Council
approved
it
The
State
Duma
or
lower
house
of
the
parliament
on
Friday
passed
the
bill
with
420
parliamentarians
voting
yes
seven
voting
against

one
abstaining
However
the
anti-Magnitsky
Act
was
not
supported
by
all
the
Russians
On
Wednesday
the
Moscow
police
have
detained
four
people
near

Federation

building
who
were
protesting
against
the
bill
Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The

which
grants
all

people
a

are
set
to
strengthen

Tmall

have
gradually

of

in

a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the
market
in

did
not
say
how
much

share
the

70

in

Although

In

the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's

industry
is
set
to
decline
in
the

partly
because

will

the
35-year-old
had
a
ready

for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We

West

its

ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N

Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar

undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We

U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
the
vehicle
including
Abu
Adnan
who
silently
approached
the
car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not
introduce
himself
until
I
asked
who
he
was
later
We
drove
to
a
small
cold
concrete
room
with
a
tiny
window
that
barely
let
in
any
light
from
an
already
overcast
sky
We
sat
among
boxes
of
long-life
milk
and
bags
of
blankets
and
winter
clothes
waiting
to
be
distributed
Our
host
the
driver
tried
to
start
a
portable
gas
heater
but
there
was
no
gas
America
has
called
us
terrorists
because
it
says
that
some
of
our
tactics
bear
the
fingerprints
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de
guerre
of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
Israel
The
U.S
Treasury
Department
has
also
slapped
financial
sanctions
against
two
men
it
believes
are
senior
leaders
in
the
militia
group
Maysar
Ali
Musa
Abdallah
al-Juburi
and
Anas
Hasan
Khattab
Recent
media
reports
also
mention
one
Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
to
bakeries
We
are
keeping
the
price
of
bread
at
15
lira
about
21
U.S
cents
which
was
its
true
price
Abu
Adnan
said
adding
that
transgressors
would
be
punished
according
to
Shari¡®a
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
also
thus
far
avoided
indiscriminate
civilian
casualties
That¡¯s
not
to
say
that
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
have
fierce
critics
especially
within
rebel
circles
In
addition
to
its
civilian
detractors
many
more
secular-minded
fighters
are
wary
of
the
group¡¯s
social
conservatism
but
insist
that
its
brand
of
ultraconservative
Islam
will
not
find
a
home
in
any
post-Assad
Syria
These
fighters
often
say
that
they
will
deal
with
conservative
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
later
but
that
right
now
they
need
them
in
the
fight
against
Assad
Other
rebels
view
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
a
transient
jihadi
group
that
will
move
onto
foreign
fronts
like
Afghanistan
or
Gaza
after
the
fall
of
Assad
Abu
Adnan
smirked
when
asked
to
comment
about
such
sentiments
especially
by
fellow
Sunni
fighters
whom
he
dismissed
as
the
brainwashed
He
repeated
that
the
idea
that
we
are
a
global
organization
or
that
we
have
some
other
goal
elsewhere
after
the
fall
is
not
true
He
was
emphatic
We
are
Syrians
He
admitted
that
we
also
have
foreigners
who
came
from
other
countries
but
he
explained
that
is
because
the
wounds
in
the
Arab
lands
are
the
same
wound
and
the
oppression
is
the
same
oppression
A
minute
I
always
feel
so
long
Think
of
me
and
your
chance
Less
and
less
as
if
by
the
end
of
life
We
separate
with
each
other
The
world
of
two
people
each
other
again
A
minute
I'm
drunk
wine
a
few
times
The
evening
of
that
day
I'm
a
night
did
not
return
you
want
to
A
minute
Appear
in
front
of
you
you
want
me
to
repent
But
time
constraints
no
waiting
a
minute
Is
the
morning
you
find
I'm
a
night
that
night
Who
knows
in
the
noon
time
I
am
the
soft
bed
happy
to
sleep
But
you
have
to
use
a
minute
Wake
me
up
the
rumble
of
the
scolded
I
feel
very
feel
shy
When
I
want
to
take
a
minute
to
make
up
But
you
never
give
me
a
chance
And
you
say
we
are
the
best
choice
to
leave
I
used
a
few
years
time
Build
a
charming
scenery
wall
And
now
you
say
collapse
will
collapse
I'm
unwilling
heart
want
to
take
a
minute
To
redeem
my
fault
I
beg
you
said
to
me
Not
I
do
not
give
you
the
opportunity
But
given
the
opportunity
you
have
to
cherish
So
we
each
other
to
leave
for
good
That
night
the
minutes
But
it
doesn't
make
you
took
from
my
dreams
May
the
minute
for
you
Is
already
in
the
past
for
me
A
minute
is
an
indelible
scar
Forever
in
your
heart
the
brand
mark
The
nine
seven
half
of
the
year
I
graduated
from
the
primary
school
took
more
than
two
months
holiday
oneself
in
boring
boring
nothing
for
me
to
do
Probably
because
I
was
in
primary
school
has
over
two
times
the
level
or
that
I
was
in
the
primary
school
stage
without
ambition
my
result
difference
make
them
disappointed
disappointed
again
in
helpless
situation
teachers
do
not
stay
in
my
class
From
the
beginning
to
repeat
things
because
be
informed
parents
I
have
the
opinion
very
much
but
that
s
not
for
me
to
say
but
parents
and
teachers
say
so
in
the
two
years
younger
than
I
classmates
together
side
by
side
I
was
very
uncomfortable
psychological
also
feel
very
guilty
Only
this
guilt
and
inner
pain
no
one
can
imagine
Then
to
the
junior
high
school
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
neighborhood
folks
have
advised
me
not
to
read
so
I
went

I
seem
to
be

so
I
read
no

also

a
long
time
I
didn't
know
how
to
grade
their
own
have
been
waiting
when
my
anxiety
to
fifth
days
at
the
same
time
the
junior
middle
school
admission
notice
to
can
not
write
performance
I
can
not
find
out
their
performance
is
bad
or
good
not
over
the
admission
notice
I
was
happy
but
when
the
notice
it
but
found
that
there
was
no
money
at
home
for
me
to
read
and
I
feel
it
This
day
Friday
daddy

as
I
gather
books

home
and
left
me
and
my
mother
two
Father
outside
money
very
hard
a
week
later
did
not
wait
for
the
dad
who
come
back
home
I
was
boring
occasionally
also
help
mother
do
some
housework
but
most
of
the
time
I
am
a
person
sits
on
the
bed
or
on
the
wheelchair
When
I
was
home
to
sit
to
uncle
home
to
flow
because
the
uncle's
path
is
the
only
way
which
must
be
passed
on
the
junior
high
school
so
when
the
school
in
the
school
I'll
be
watching
them
back
and
forth
it
seems
that
I'm
reading
way
does
not
give
up
Father
borrow
money
did
not
come
back
but
the
family
tattle
and
prate
much
rise
when
aunt
in
my
ears
ago
often
nag
daddy
thing
I
feel
creepy
why
is
it
so
Dad
why
Dad
You

back
You
come
back
quickly
I
prefer
not
to
read
will
not
let
you
be
such
grievances
such
insults
Dad
Dad
What
are
you
Why
are
they
so
say
you
I
have
been
to
have
been
waiting
for
his
return
Aunt
said
your
father
too
do
bad
name
that
he
do
it
really
lost
your
face
For
a
start
I
don't
know
what
happened
the
mood
is
very
heavy
asked
aunt
how
Is
there
anything
so
so
serious
Aunt
aggravated
by
an
angry
tone
said
your
father
outside
in
order
to
give
you
borrow
books
first
to
your
aunt's
house
he
said
the
home
to
buy
cattle
need
to
borrow
money
so
aunt
to
know
no
such
thing
so
don't
borrow
To
the
ancient
city
of
leaf
Tingjia
your
father's
friends
said
to
buy
chemical
fertilizer
to
borrow
a
little
money
Tingjia
leaves
no
he
will
go
to
your
grandma's
house
to
you
two
uncle's
house
to
borrow
your
dad
said
is
to
build
a
house
your
uncle
happened
to
encounter
village
grow
there
ask
he
once
topic
was
exposed
he
had
to
go
to
Ningbo
and
the
town
of
Evergreen
s
aunt
s
home
to
borrow
they
have
had
to
go
to
Shangjie
discussed
In
fact
I
was
really
want
to
ask
why
he
did
know
go
to
Ningbo
to
evergreen
all
be
crystal
clear
isn't
he
is
immortal
But
I
think
if
I
really
ask
those
words
do
not
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
again
I
heard
a
few
times
she
simply
said
you
don't
read
simply
go
out
work
I
thought
if
Dad
comes
back
I
can't
read
but
sometimes
I
am
unwilling
heart
no
matter
what
was
advised
in
the
school
I
had
a
few
lessons
can
comfort
my
soul
As
for
the
aunt's
words
I
don't
want
to
hear
but
also
do
not
want
to
use
it
The
school
school
for
several
days
Dad
Don't
see
at
that
time
I
was
a
little
worried
but
those
tattle
and
prate
is
not
stopped
but
also
the
diffusion
constant
at
While
I
thought
in
my
mind
my
father
come
back
and
side
wanted
dad
to
lend
money
to
come
back
I
can
take
a
good
read
I
do
not
want
to
give
up
all
of
a
sudden
but
to
no
avail
since
the
tattle
and
prate
my
heart
was
tortured
to
death
Mom
In
addition
to
complaining
that
father
outside
sometimes
also
want
to
talk
to
scold
me
maybe
she
more
recently
than
I
was
upset
so
she
wants
to
say
I
she
said
to
me
and
I
don't
chew
sound
One
day
I
went
to
his
aunt's
house
because
the
boring
to
my
aunt's
house
behind
the
bamboo
inside
to
digging
up
bamboo
shoots
when
I
really
dig
vigorously
suddenly
heard
the
mother's
cry
I
came
down
to
see
his
aunt
said
Daddy
things
let
s
lose
face
so
my
mother
sometimes
hard
to
explain
for
oneself
sometimes
feel
helpless
because
she
feels
she
jumped
into
the
the
Yellow
River
wash
not
clear
so
she
felt
wronged
cry
In
fact
say
mother
instigated
is
possible
the
key
is
my
own
request
forcing
the
father
in
the
back
of
the
eternal
infamy
to
say
in
the
final
analysis
is
my
fault
so
I
ought
to
I
heard
my
mother
weeping
I
also
feel
very
sad
This
a
few
days
later
mother's
mood
has
not
been
good
if
not
more
I
see
my
mother
like
this
is
very
worried
After
a
few
days
of
school
another
week
has
passed
I
also
miss
dad
Don't
know
Dad
outside
doing
may
be
I
worry
most
X
x
on
the
evening
the
sun
nearly
down
hill
Dad
came
back
I
go
first
call
dad
like
my
father
and
several
years
not
to
meet
such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
say
uncle
s
contribution
but
not
all
because
I
have
three
hundred
yuan
to
make
books
uncle
didn't
go
with
me
in
the
said
dad
before
he
has
not
called
me
to
junior
high
school
but
a
three
again
three
advised
me
to
give
up
reading
now
papa
got
money
made
a
part
of
my
books
I
read
to
say
to
their
credit
is
a
little
exaggerated
Father
left
home
also
no
rest
was
mother
shouted
did
mother's
grievance
venting
gas
while
the
father
was
annoyed
do
not
know
to
whom
to
tell
he

Mother
said

The

cheat

Oh
So

people

begging
Dad
shouted
who
said
that
To
who
said
that
You
give
me
a
call
My
accusers
Mother
said
without
confrontation
the
village
has
spread
to
open
You

the
village

make
inquiries

know
You're
so

to
them

Dad
said
Mother
said
your
sister-in-law
also
said
do
not
believe
you
can
go
and
ask
him
do
their
own
things
to
know
Later
my
father
also
do
not
know
to
have
to
confront
this
thing
Buleerle
But
the
father
and
mother
are
very
long
time
had
not
spoken
always
keep
silence
state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
very
so
stay
at
home
for
too
long
you
feel
so
lonely
and
boring
parents
also
I
have
no
job
but
feel
puzzled
think
it
over
and
over
again
had
no
friends
who
can
help
me
introduce
then
find
the
parents
remember
my
cousin
D
s
so
that
when
they
think
of
commissioned
sister-in-law
R's
called
D
took
me
to
the
city
to
work
F
F

located
on
the
edge
of
the
Fuchun
River
the
most
difficult
beautiful
county

also
my
hometown

administrative
center
Although
the
city
as
it
is
my
most
beautiful
dream
also
is
I
most
look
forward
to
come
to
one
of
the
city
but
because

economically
not
rich
or
because
I
was
in
the
city
without
known
relatives
so
only
stayed
in
the
countryside
most
lifetime
until
since
junior
high
school
lost
study
economic
benefits
I
forced
to
quit
school
but
in
the
country
for
half
a
year
have
the
honor
to
the
D
s
lead
I
first
came
to
the
city
to
work
Since
D
s
hear
my
boring
at
home
after
the
state
he
was
in
the
very
next
day
morning
speeding
and
returned
to
his
hometown
urged
me
to
go
to
the
city
to
do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or
promises
probably
at
that
time
I
have
been
in
the
dream
of
the
life
in
the
city
there's
nothing
to
refuse
the
And
in
that
day
in
the
evening
mother
to
prepare
my
luggage
the
kerosene
lamp
she
gave
me

clothes
while
sewing
clothes
of
a
hole
while
another
nag
told
me
A
Cheng
You
have
never
been
to
the
city
what
must
listen
to
your
cousin's
arrangement
don't
go
out
on
a
night
out
that
will
make
your
brother
worry
will
let
us
worry
there
is
the
question
of
your
life
must
be
well
orderly
and
you
wear
and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother
and
friends
will
look
down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said
you
know
now
but
really
to
the
city
after
you
is
it
right
Our
words
as
unheeded
advice
that
an
inlet
and
an
outlet
to
forget
about
and
do
I
hope
you
not
if
you
so
dad
wouldn't
want
to
control
you
The
night
his
father
for
the
first
time
to
drink
is
also
the
first
time
that
I
drank
tincture
MOET
drunk
I
in
the
night
imperceptibly
in
wheezing
to
sleep
Early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
I
also
in
outdoor
breathe
fresh
air
waiting
for
mother
made
breakfast
eat
a
good
meal
with
my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also
can
Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or
accept
it
D's
said
rest
assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her
I
will
give
him
his
money
saved
in
the
home
My
father
put
the
money
back
pocket
looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
that
here
was
the
last
miss
that
my
heart
is
full
of
hope
full
of
ideals
is
my
nostalgia
reminds
me
of
the
beauty
of
my
hometown
As
tears
like
springs
that
my
surging
mood
as
in
heaven
so
here
swear
resolutely
obey
D's
command
I
went
to
Lake
source
direction
to
horse
sword
shift
car
went
straight
to
the
F
town
Go
forward
with
great
strength
and
vigour
to
the
F
city
F
City
we
in
the
long-distance
passenger
station
of
the
car
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
city
I
think
it's
great
it
is
because
I
first
saw
the
perfect
city
probably
for
the
city
people
the
city
is
not
big
because
there
are
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
such
as
Shanghai
Hangzhou
Nanjing
are
so
But
I
look
I
see
it
is
because
I
have
no
contact
with
the
city
and
the
first
contact
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
novelty
I
felt
that
here
is
my
dream
of
heaven
D
s
first
got
out
of
the
car
I
have
to
get
off
the
streets
together
with
him
I
don't
know
what
this
is
what
Lane
Road
always
feel
in
the
alley
as
in
gossip
so
I
feel
I
can't
touch
the
North
East
and
touched
the
East
has
touched
the
north
deeply
he
was
puzzled
When
I
came
to
a
river
river
sides
erected
a
high-rise
blocks
I
always
thought
that
this
is
the
Fuchun
River
I
really
think
you
saw
the
Fuchun
River
I
was
a
sigh
and
said
the
Fuchun
River
does
not
have
such
a
river
I
didn't
necessarily
it
big
D's
said
this
is
not
the
Fuchun
River
but
an
amaranth
Pujiang
I
said
oh
It
is
my
illusion
Words
I
am
his
behind
but
when
we
are
at
the
crossroads
in
the
middle
turn
right
this
is
a
long
hill
road
Liuzhou
Road
building
is
bristly
and
let
me
feel
the
perfect
city
economy
is
thriving
and
prosperous
each
poineering
hardships
may
make
it
difficult
to
imagine
as
I
came
to
a
world
came
to
a
childhood
paradise
I
see
a
paradise
of
dream
in
my
nose
to
dazzle
along
the
road
of
hill
of
dragon
of
the
past
it
is
a
city
surrounded
by
people
in
and
out
of
the
mall
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
in
the
commercial
city
upstairs
to
write
the
Fuchun
River
commercial
city
it
seems
like
I
know
this
is
F
the
city's
most
bustling
shopping
center
the
most
bustling
sidewalks
I
just
want
to
say
the
city
of
F
F
really
great
I
came
to
this
strange
city
I
really
feel
in
this
strange
city
I
can
absorb
your
sunny
temperament
to
be
a
city
that
the
giants
I
am
going
to
show
themselves
When
I
didn't
see
enough
outside
downtown
scene
I
was
D's
to
the
commercial
city
there
are
all
the
stalls
food
stands
above
the
green
vegetables
eggplant
garlic
onion
bean
curd
a
kind
sister
church
where
D's
stall
led
me
here
and
sister
chatted
a
while
when
the
elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
is
to
eat
lunch
saw
us
big
brother
put
down
his
chopsticks
call
us
to
sit
down
then
O
O
said
A
Cheng
Your
dinner
have
you
had
dinner
yet
I
haven't
answered
D's
for
I
said
we
have
no
Big
brother
says
here
to
eat
not
home
to
burn
She
also
said
yes
Or
here
to
eat
even
home
to
burn
much
trouble
D's
said
not
so
polite
home
to
burn
it
it
didn't
take
long
very
fast
He
made
the
remarks
at
the
same
time
I
still
look
around
because
I
see
here
is
such
a
big
stall
is
also
the
first
time
saw
so
many
dishes
people
buy
vegetable
stall
So
my
curiosity
in
here
is
not
fun
When
I
put
the
spirit
are
concentrated
in
the
food
stalls
of
things
he
finished
on
the
go
I'm
still
hazy
a
bit
at
a
loss
situation
he
said
to
me
A
Cheng
we
go
I
didn't
hear
there
is
one
point
be
absent-minded
look
he
coaxed
out
of
said
hello
What's
on
your
mind
Told
you
so
loudly
did
not
hear
Go
I
said
oh
Elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
to
pick
some
fresh
vegetables
let
you
bring
us
back
to
cook
he
and
I
left
sister
they
couple
booth
then
to
another
butcher
shop
stall
bought
several
kilograms
of
meat
left
the
commercial
city
and
imperceptibly
and
through
a
Malaysian
Road
came
to
a
named
Zhou
Jianong
lane
across
the
alley
alley
went
to
D's
house
D's
house
is
an
underground
garage
inside
a
very
the
smell
is
also
important
I
very
want
to
move
out
but
I
will
not
economic
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
environment
here
it
is
the
parents
of
thousand
exhort
enjoin
let
I
firmly
remember
them
you
want
me
to
listen
to
D's
so
I
had
to
reluctantly
stay
When
I
walked
inside
the
heat
from
the
outside
directly
to
heaven
so
I
really
feel
it's
hard
I
am
afraid
went
into
the
furnace
of
the
house
let
me
really
angry
be
ashamed
of
dying
When
I
was
in
the
hot
sun
dried
by
the
sun
at
the
same
time
D's
said
why
don't
you
come
in
Quickly
Wash
dishes
I
went
to
go
say
to
him
it
is
too
hot
I
have
a
bit
of
a
bear
D's
continued
hot
A
fan
Do
not
be
afraid
of
heat
a
long
time
to
get
over
I
come
too
but
we
insist
on
the
stand
A
man
should
be
afraid
of
tired
we
are
so
out
of
practice
I
said
oh
Came
to
give
him
food
finished
lunch
he's
out
let
me
have
a
rest
at
home
for
a
day
starting
tomorrow
I
promised
D's
a
boring
also
have
a
look
at
the
room
television
occasionally
to
bring
home
the
story
books
doubled
the
old
warm
up
in
primary
and
secondary
schools
the
residual
reading
difficulty
One
day
in
the
imperceptibly
in
the
past
soon
arrived
at
dusk
D's
also
returned
to
cook
I
don't
know
how
to
cook
so
there
are
a
lot
of
housework
is
D's
one
person
to
complete
I
can
only
one
wash
dishes
clean
the
room
health
or
what
other
are
not
good
At
night
after
dinner
D's
and
I
had
to
watch
TV
in
bed
TV
also
is
no
good
program
I
watched
a
imperceptibly
fell
asleep
Suddenly
I
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
I
will
readily
but
here
I
can
not
find
the
toilet
was
anxious
to
panic
I
find
that
I
finally
find
convenient
corner
when
I
finished
returned
was
a
patrol
car
through
here
I
was
found
by
police
as
a
thief
was
caught
The
car
out
of
the
two
patrol
to
check
my
ID
card
I
came
to
the
interior
from
my
bag
show
identity
cards
to
give
them
they
took
out
the
register
put
my
name
and
identity
card
number
is
recorded
in
it
and
again
and
again
I
ask
my
family
and
address
then
they
contact
D
s
asked
his
identity
asked
his
work
address
information
is
very
detailed
and
they
have
put
D
s
identity
as
a
pledge
export
to
a
television
set
let
him
leave
the
TV
invoice
and
specifications
to
verify
can
put
his
things
he
returned
to
the
He
had
to
accept
to
let
them
D's
until
the
patrol
had
gone
he
said
how
can
you
not
carefully
let
the
guard
discovered
I
said
I
don't
know
How
do
I
know
the
night
police
so
fiercely
knew
that
I
wouldn't
back
out
D's
continued
next
to
a
sharp
point
don't
be
so
idiotic
Know
or
not
Said
oh
Know
Put
out
the
light
then
we
sleep
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
sleep
at
night
because
the
room
was
at
night
is
also
very
difficult
to
eliminate
unless
the
outside
temperature
drops
to
the
upper
20s
degrees
after
midnight
there
may
be
more
comfortable
Wake
up
the
first
thing
I
do
is
to
wash
brush
work
then
I
put
a
few
of
the
ash
bucket
and
a
large
shovels
and
in
D
s
back
leading
me
to
play
first
In
fact
I
don't
know
what
is
hard
what
is
helpless
life
I
have
not
try
at
home
parents
regard
me
as
a
saint
as
for
at
that
time
I
feel
so
blessed
and
now
I
can
only
obey
D's
leadership
as
his
apprentice
I
came
to
the
city
gates
then
turn
to
the
Old
Road
South
Gate
Street
South
Gate
Street
rely
on
the
Fuchun
River
and
that
a
large
river
it
is
the
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
we
stand
position
is
the
Fuchun
River
ferry
terminal
just
because
it
is
against
the
direction
of
the
city
to
the
South
so
it
means
draw
road
also
known
as
South
Gate
Street
near
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
I
came
here
did
not
look
at
the
moon
not
here
on
vacation
trip
or
something
I
was
just
a
young
worker
come
to
the
edge
of
the
the
Fuchun
River
many-storied
buildings
work
most
beautiful
the
Fuchun
River
river
I
and
it
are
not
fate
I
climbed
to
the
six
floor
of
this
building
opened
the
door
there
are
several
woodworking
early
start
working
here
their
decoration
process
of
half
I
come
here
only
a
toilet
and
a
wing
not
paved
tiles
This
is
D
s
and
I
started
to
do
it
My
first
day
at
work
is
to
carry
cement
bag
or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too
much
I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
is
D
s
wake
me
from
this
dream
urged
me
to
go
to
work
I
mistily
mistily
to
get
up
go
to
work
work
on
the
path
of
two
feet
in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a
little
be
petrified
like
How
can
I
not
to
mention
the
spirit
Seems
to
me
the
wholeEven
if
more
magnificent
rhetoric
Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk
the
voice
Beat
the
floor
Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me
babble
learn
language
I
learned
to
language
in
the
river
The
first
word-mom
How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only
for

mosquitoes
Breeze
send
me
to
sleep
But
regardless
of
the
eyebrows
climb
sweat
poured
Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite
write
of
word
Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
and
vertical
dignified
and
imposing
You
said
that
a
man
have
to
like
it
Young
i
was
not
sensible
Occasionally
make
a
mistake
You
taught
me
the
force
of
justice
I
keep
in
mind
your
word
Dare
not
have
a
bit
slight
In
order
to
build
a
quiet
environment
for
my
studies
The
already
heavy
burden
of
the
family
You
take
on
all
the
housework
and
farm
work
Even
if
was
too
tired
to
take
a
breath
Also
won't
let
me
take
part
in
I
was
moved
to
nothing
to
say
In
my
memory
You've
never

coin
You

what
is
bitter
What

On

And

like
the

man
to
regain
the
light
when
injustice
and
resentment
All
the
world
don't
understand
me
Only

In

I
started
back
to
have
a
look
their
growth
path
one
every
day
watching
I
alone
posture
standing
on
the
roadside
inserted
his

in

I
see
countless
people
from
my
side
deadpan
passed
by
they
came
on
with
the
coffee
holding
a
drink
take
the
textbook
with
mobile
phone
They
be
in
a
hurry
to
depart
put
me
off
like
an
idle
about
Occasionally
someone
stopped

at
me
I
know
these

Guo
Jingming
said
my
friends
are
my
courage
to
live
and
they
give
me
your
ability
let
me
face
this
world
no
longer
panic
Those
who
have
and
be
crazy
with
me
with
sadness
with
cycling
through
the
thin
youth
friend
I
think
we
all
remember
the
youth
is
how
we
face
cannot
erase
the
traces
Xiao
chen
went
to
Hainan
in
a
dessert
shop
as
dessert
Whenever
we
have
a
vacation
will
be
received
her
phone
call
she
received
the
text
message
she
always
likes
to
write
very
long
As
it
was
she
knew
I
was
a
very
insecure
afraid
to
lose
even
if
there
is
no
important
will
also
write
a
long
message
let
me
know
her
by
my
side
never
leave
Chen
is
a
very
clever
girl
but
in
the
study
does
not
enlighten
after
each
test
there
will
always
be
that
her
poor
grades
in
my
front
side
into
my
mouth
ice
cream
a
begged
me
to
help
her
with
We
have
been
together
for
9
years
so
only
a
piece
of
memory
I
always
thought
she
was
a
bright
child
happy
and
simple
life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
From
the
bright
sunlight
If
the
rain
from
the
cloud
Break
your
pride
Think
of
my
love
for
you
And
everything
shall
be
fine
Let
us
soar
let
us
fly
To
the
highest
height
And
everything
shall
be
fineLast
year
the
cancer
nearly
finished
me
off
However
with
the
accompaniment
of
my
best
friend
Candice
I
could
eventually
get
through
these
tough
time
Sometimes
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
always
stand
by
my
side
Last
summer
the
doctor
discovered
that
I
suffered
from
lung
cancer
At
that
moment
I
was
completely
shocked
All
memories
that
I
have
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
in
seconds
I
thought
I
was
going
to
leave
all
my
friends
my
family
and
all
people
I
loved
To
me
the
whole
world
was
just
sinking
Luckily
that
was
just
in
an
early
stage
and
the
doctor
said
that
I
had
I
great
chance
to
recover
after
a
series
of
treatments
But
he
warned
me
that
the
treatment
would
be
very
tough
and
painful
At
first
I
have
considered
to
refuse
the
treatment
However
after
I
have
though
about
all
of
my
valuable
friends
and
my
mom
and
dad
I
chose
to
take
the
chance
During
the
treatment
I
gradually
suffered
from
the
side
effects
The
number
of
hairs
on
my
head
declined
and
I
vomited
from
dawn
till
night
on
every
single
day
I
had
a
very
poor
appetite
and
I
nearly
had
no
desired
to
put
any
food
to
my
mouth
I
was
very
painful
and
I
was
thinking
about
giving
up
the
treatment
I
though
I
could
not
tolerate
it
anymore
However
with
the
support
and
encouragement
from
my
best
friend
Candice
I
have
eventually
made
it
through
the
rain
and
stand
up
once
again
Finally
I
recovered
One
summer
night
Candice
came
to
the
hospital
to
visit
me
We
sat
on
the
bench
that
facing
the
sea
The
sun
was
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
night
descended
We
chatted
underneath
the
stars
We
have
not
met
each
other
since
the
graduation
Candice
said
with
tears
on
her
face
Yes
I
have
never
thought
we
would
have
the
reunion
in
the
situation
I
said
She
kept
silent
with
her
tears
in
the
warm
gentle
breeze
We
have
been
best
friends
since
we
were
small
I
do
not
want
this
friendship
to
end
up
so
soon
She
cried
desperately
Zach
you
are
a
man
You
are
a
man
who
is
courageous
and
adventurous
You
should
have
that
guts
to
fight
for
your
life
and
people
around
you
But
Now
I
am
going
to
give
you
the
courage
you
need
She
lay
her
hand
on
me
Lord
please
give
this
little
boy
love
and
hope
to
face
the
obstacle
that
he
is
now
facing
Please
give
him
courage
to
help
him
to
find
the
way
Now
you
have
already
possessed
the
ability
to
fight
this
war
You
should
never
give
up
as
there
is
a
light
in
your
heart
and
shines
very
brightly
Since
them
I
understand
that
when
fate
is
tough
just
toughen
your
faith
With
a
smile
I
know
I
could
face
the
future
no
matter
what
lay
ahead
And
there's
a
hero
comes
along
with
the
strength
to
carry
on
My
dad
has
always
used
this
song
to
encourage
me
Until
he
passed
away
I
still
keep
this
song
in
my
iPod
and
listen
to
it
when
I
need
to
get
through
some
tough
time
To
me
this
song
does
not
only
symbolize
the
spirit
of
my
dad
but
also
mine
This
song
is
ubiquitous
in
various
singing
competitions
Regardless
of
its
singing
technique
the
beautiful
melody
and
those
meaningful
lyrics
has
helped
many
people
to
get
through
obstacles
This
fabulous
song
was
composed
by
American
singer-songwriter
Mariah
Carey
in
1993
and
definitely
performed
by
herself
The
song
mentioned
that
among
every
single
one
of
us
a
hero
lies
inside
our
heart
If
we
try
to
reach
into
our
soul
our
emptiness
will
disappear
There's
a
hero
if
you
look
inside
your
heart
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid
of
who
you
are
When
I
was
small
I
was
a
child
who
was
so
fragile
and
cried
easily
I
was
afraid
of
everything
I
was
so
this
and
small
and
when
my
classmates
bullied
me
all
I
would
do
was
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
and
cry
from
dawn
till
night
Worse
still
I
was
poor
in
academic
result
and
no
teachers
loved
me
On
these
days
I
found
myself
useless
and
believed
that
no
one
in
this
world
would
recognise
this
small
potato
I
was
so
desperate
Yet
in
one
dark
night
my
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
hand
was
so
large
and
warm
All
I
could
feel
was
the
love
and
hope
transmitted
through
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
and
to
my
heart
and
soul
Son
you
should
not
be
fragile
anymore
But
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
Now
I
am
going
to
recall
your
hero
from
your
soul
and
from
now
on
you
would
never
feel
lonely
anymore
My
hero
and
your
hero
have
already
stayed
together
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
Other
people
can
say
anything
they
want
to
say
Although
they
try
to
bring
you
down
you
will
never
allow
them
to
do
so
because
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
This
hero
will
always
stay
close
to
you
and
protect
you
forever
Afterwards
he
sang
this
song
to
me
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow
But
don't
let
anyone
to
tear
them
away
Since
then
whenever
I
need
to
face
any
problems
or
obstacles
alone
I
will
not
be
fragile
anymore
All
I
need
to
do
is
sing
Hero
along
with
my
hero
and
my
father's
hero
and
I
will
certainly
know
that
my
father
will
guide
me
where
I
should
go
I
know
that
there
is
a
light
in
me
and
shines
very
brightly
and
other
people
can
try
but
they
can
never
take
that
away
from
me
The
meeting
is
WangHai
Time
always
unknowingly
hurried
away
flash
Also
in
the
online
to
spend
a
few
years
Cry
also
laughed
Thousands
of
day
and
night
WangHai
roaming
A
thought
to
mature
Walk
to
the
friend
go
to
How
many
friends
already
not
disappear
Sitting
alone
in
the
space
is
cold
and
cheerless
Some
vague
sad
loss
Thankfully
Have
a
lot
of
friends
have
been
silent
about
Accompany
me
along
the
way
Always
buchibuqi
In
the
virtual
network
Deduce
true
feelings
Behind
the
screen
in
the
cold
And
each
wish
Whenever
the
birthday
Will
receive
blessings
of
friends
Very
often
I
moved
ShiXi
unceasingly
Thanks
friends
gifts
and
blessing
Because
of
you
Lonely
night
has
not
lonely
Because
of
you
My
birthday
is
not
cold
and
cheerless
Of
a
friend
said
I
am
not
alone
My
friend
Thousands
of
WanLiLi
just
a
moment
of
distance
Don't
need
name
also
need
not
face
Both
you
and
I
Thank
you

in
front

your
friends
When

You

by
saying

none

When

When

deeply
she

You

halfway
across

When

it
openly
to
their

There's
no
substitute
for
her
Cherish
every

moment
Though
at
times
she
may
not
be
the
best
of
friends
may
not
agree
to
our
thoughts
she
is
still
your
mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left
Thomas
Carlyle
lived
from
1795
until
1881
He
was
a
10000
wow
gold
Scot
essayist
and
historian
During
his
lifetime
he
became
one
of
the
world's
greatest
writers
But
he
was
a
human
and
storage
rack

On
October

1826
wow

paypal
Carlyle
married
his
secretary
Jane
Welsh
She
was
an
intelligent
attractive
and
somewhat
temperamental
daughter
of
a
well-to-do
doctor
They
had
their
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
but
still
loved
Bathroom
Vanities
each
other
dearly
After
their
marriage
Jane
continued
to
serve
as
his
secretary
But
after
several
years
of
marriage
Jane
became
ill
Being
Bathroom
Mirrors
a
hard
worker
Carlyle
became
so
absorbed
in
his
writings
that
he
let
Jane
continue
working
for
several
weeks
after
she
became
ill
She
had
cancer
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
slow
growing
kind
she
finally
became
confined
to
her
bed
Although
Carlyle
loved
her
Bathroom
Accessories
dearly
he
very
seldom
found
time
to
stay
with
her
long
He
was
busy
with
his
work
when
Jane
died
they
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
for
the
service
The
day
Glass
Basin
was
a
miserable
day
It
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
Following
the
funeral
Carlyle
went
back
to
his
home
He
was
taking
it
pretty
hard
He
went
up
the
stairs
to
Jane's
room
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
her
bed
He
sat
there
thinking
Shower
Enclosures
about
how
little
time
he
had
spent
with
her
and
wishing
so
much
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
differently
Noticing
her
diary
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
picked
it
up
and
began
to
steel
shelving
read
it
Suddenly
he
seemed
shocked
He
saw
it
There
on
one
page
she
had
written
Interior
Doors
a
single
line
Yesterday
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
and
it
was
like
heaven
I
love
him
so
Something
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
He
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
that
he
meant
so
much
to
her
He
thought
of
all
wow
gold
australia
the
times
he
had
gone
about
his
work
without
thinking
about
and
noticing
her
Then
Carlyle
turned
the
page
in
the
diary
There
he
noticed
she
racking
had
written
some
words
that
broke
his
heart
I
have
listened
all
day
to
hear
his
steps
in
the
hall
but
now
it
is
late
and
I
guess
he
won't
come
today
Carlyle
read
a
little
more
in
the
book
Then
he
threw
it
down
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Some
of
his
friends
found
him
at
the
grave
his
buy
wow
gold
australia
face
buried
in
the
mud
His
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
Tears
continued
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
He
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
If
I
had
only
known
if
I
had
only
known
But
it
was
too
late
for
Carlyle
She
was
dead
After
Jane's
death
Carlyle
made
world
of
warcraft
gold
for
sale
little
attempt
to
write
again
The
historians
say
he
lived
another
15
years
weary
bored
and
a
partial
recluse
I
share
the
story
with
in
the
hope
that
you
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
While
our
loved
ones
must
have
the
money
we
make
to
live
it
is
the
love
we
have
that
they
really
want
Give
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
It
is
not
easy
to
define
what
kind
of
meaning
to
the
enterprise
culture
because
the
enterpise
culture
stems
from
the
ration
and
reality
which
should
be
related
to
the
regulations
or
how
to
react
to
the
risk
of
management
or
market
instead
of
just
focusing
on
training
and
meeting
which
should
be
related
to
the
proportion
of
thoughts
of
belonging
to
our
company
and
benefitting
our
company
in
the
difficulty
Sometimes
the
puzzled
people
are
always
in
the
mess
of
understanding
of
why
the
itemized
regulations
could
not
optimize
the
operation
and
not
regulate
the
action
of
some
officials
who
always
abused
the
power
to
benefit
themselves
which
lead
to
the
argument
that
as
long
as
the
company
is
so
large
that
the
culture
of
enterprise
is
absolutly
difficult
to
be
built
up
Different
people
with
different
education
background
and
different
comprehension
of
society
would
not
be
integrated
to
the
common
recognition
of
enterprise
culture
which
is
the
crux
to
help
the
company
be
prosperous
In
spite
of
training
many
officials
there
are
lots
of
bottlenecks
which
should
be
smoothed
and
holes
which
should
be
covered
so
we
must
work
out
some
measures
to
make
our
company
step
on
the
right
road
Regulations
are
parts
of
the
enterprise
culture
making
the
road
straight
but
what
kind
of
regulations
are
suitful
to
the
state-owned
company
The
regulation
are
always
eroded
by
dereliction
and
are
not
always
strickly
implemented
by
some
departments
Frankly
speaking
the
enterprise
culture
is
just
having
some
aspects
in
consciousness
frequently
dominating
the
behavior
which
would
give
us
some
reference
on
how
to
enact
the
detailed
regulations
could
get
the
return
as
expected
The
most
important
thing
related
to
the
enterprise
culture
is
how
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
in
the
every
respect
of
operation
We
must
detail
every
process
of
how
to
control
the
cost
and
how
to
make
the
work
efficient
and
rational
If
employee
could
make
their
regulations
rooted
in
mind
they
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
keep
them
from
dereliction
and
would
try
their
best
to
devote
the
wisdom
to
benifitting
our
company.For
example
The
flaws
in
human
nature
and
the
shortage
of
wealth
would
seduce
the
officals
to
accept
the
secret
money
from
agencies
who
are
intended
to
pull
down
the
officals
by
all
kinds
of
tactics
and
if
the
officals
are
too
fragile
to
resist
the
gifts
they
would
be
united
with
agencies
to
cheat
our
company
so
the
task
which
brooks
no
delay
is
the
education
brainwashing
and
making
the
severe
punishment
happen
without
them
the
enterprise
culture
is
like
the
moon
in
water
like
the
flowers
in
mist
like
the
stupid
being
called
clever
What
is
the
quintessence
of
the
enterprise
culture
It
is
easy
or
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
conclusion
because
it
is
a
hard
job
to
change
people¡¯s
mindset
which
is
always
in
the
prejustice.So
at
first
we
must
scrutinize
the
origin
of
the
prejustice
why
are
so
many
people
always
just
negating
others
because
we
are
extremely
lack
of
communication
to
understand
with
each
other
lacking
of
wisdom
to
tell
the
right
and
the
wrong
lacking
of
the
wide
chest
to
tolerate
the
different
ideas
wnich
lead
to
misunderstand
among
people
and
to
form
the
impasse
to
flexibly
resolve
the
thorny
problem.There
are
some
words
similar
and
implicated
with
the
word
culture
in
dictionary
such
as
communication
concoct
cooperation
coordination
copartner
control¡±
giving
us
some
metaphor
or
euphemism
that
enterprise
culture
must
depend
on
the
communication
cooperation
must
control
the
ridiculous
behavior
of
some
officials
must
concoct
the
atmosphere
from
stiff
suffocated
environment
to
the
active
creative
philosophical
philanthropic
state
of
mindset
of
everyone.But
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
behavior
spontaneously
follow
the
bright
side
of
human
being
just
because
of
the
fragile
and
selfish
nature
of
people
with
some
ignorant
knowledge
about
themselves
so
using
the
regulations
to
control
the
devil
in
their
mindset
and
encouraging
the
bold
attitude
to
resolve
the
present
and
history
problem
is
the
essential
way
of
making
the
enterprise
culture
alive
and
giving
the
light
to
the
employee
We
must
change
the
thoughts
that
we
are
isolated
by
others
we
are
just
living
for
ourself
we
are
just
focusing
on
our
private
cases
to
the
thoughts
that
if
we
can
help
each
other
if
we
believe
in
the
philosophy
of
strengthenning
the
consciousness
of
doing
the
job
positively
and
wisely
getting
good
return
we
can
achieve
the
goal
of
making
our
company
profitful
and
competitive
even
making
our
life
happy
Why
are
the
employee
always
having
no
enthusiasm
and
lacking
of
a
little
responsibility
in
their
job?why
are
there
lots
of
complaint
in
our
company?why
are
the
talented
people
resigning
quickly
from
our
company?Yes
the
salary
is
the
key
and
having
no
feeling
in
cooperation
unity
belonging
and
having
not
the
promising
future
are
the
fundamental
reasons
which
steamrollerred
the
spirit
to
be
loyal
to
company
so
putting
the
importance
of
employee
in
priority
is
the
way
of
having
the
high
competition
in
this
globallized
world
A
healthy
company
is
the
one
that
urgently
need
the
creative
advices
from
employee
in
stead
of
closing
their
eyes
filling
in
their
ears
in
front
of
the
employee
who
may
have
some
profound
and
pragmatic
ideas
which
maybe
benifit
to
the
operation
of
our
company.But
how
to
distinguish
the
good
ideas
or
the
wrong
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
leaders
who
must
look
through
everything
including
themselves
and
others
adding
that
they
must
comprehend
the
logic
of
mindset
and
behavior
of
themself
To
be
leaders
the
open
attitude
is
the
good
way
to
rationalize
the
management
adopting
the
positive
way
to
eliminate
the
flaws
in
the
structure
and
to
attain
the
goal
with
attacking
the
black
hands¡±
instead
of
always
being
in
defensive
measure
of
healing
the
fissure
in
management
that
is
deficient
in
courage
and
wisdom.It
is
also
one
part
of
the
enterprise
culture.Frankly
saying
having
good
return
to
our
company
is
dominated
by
the
fate
by
the
hearts
of
all
employee
by
the
regulations
by
the
rational
philosophy
by
the
authentic
wisdom
Service
is
the
culture
it
sounds
like
simple
but
complicated
and
profound
if
you
want
to
make
it
better
and
better
How
to
do
service
is
the
important
culture
of
enterprise
which
could
attract
many
people
to
take
our
flights
again
and
again.We
can
ask
a
simple
question
that
if
you
look
up
to
see
the
twinkled
stars
in
night
what
make
you
comfortable?The
answer
is
easy
the
bright
the
color
make
you
feel
comfortable
which
can
make
us
have
some
comprehension
that
if
you
make
people¡¯s
body
such
as
eye
ear
limbs
nose
heart
feel
nice
your
service
is
the
nice
service
if
you
make
the
customers
angry
you
failed
in
doing
service.So
you
must
think
over
how
to
make
the
customers
feel
better
is
the
best
way
to
learn
how
to
give
service
to
these
arrogant
and
hypercritical
customers
Above
all
We
can
understand
that
if
you
have
regulations
in
your
mindset
which
sometimes
is
selfish
and
Out
of
my
window
the
darkness
gave
me
a
signal:if
you
are
habitted
in
the
darkness
of
heart
you
would
be
dissappionted
for
ever.sometimes
I
want
to
find
the
way
of
making
me
in
the
positive
attitude
to
the
life
but
always
are
beated
by
my
experiences
which
cutted
off
the
robe
attached
to
the
sunshine.but
the
frustrated
happenning
is
not
the
domination
which
converts
my
good
intention
to
the
devil
the
domination
is
my
thoughts
which
are
sometimes
not
superficial
but
profound
gives
me
the
light
and
warm
to
live
simply
and
happily
What
kind
of
thoughts
would
release
my
pressure
and
gives
me
the
ability
to
survive
in
the
chilly
and
choppy
reality
which
would
distort
the
heart
fragile
to
the
fragmentary
condition
or
make
the
heart
wisom
strong
get
the
meaning
of
life
which
would
push
me
to
the
heaven
with
lots
of
beauty
and
full
I
would
say
that
my
thoughts
is
related
to
the
thoughts
themselves
if
you
can
change
the
thoughts
quickly
and
correctedly
you
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
pusure
the
objects
you
want;if
you
are
stubborn
enough
you
would
be
easily
defeated
by
the
fate
which
urgently
need
the
wisdom
light
to
cover
the
black
in
the
mindset
full
of
good
and
evil
When
I
was
a
child
I
do
not
know
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
and
have
no
faith
which
would
comfort
my
soul
to
give
me
a
light
would
direct
my
road
to
the
tranquillized
home
My
pressure
is
from
my
family
where
my
father
is
not
a
reasonable
person
and
had
no
ideas
on
how
to
cultivate
my
individual
personality
and
my
character
so
in
the
long
time
I
felt
the
life
of
mine
is
in
hell
even
if
I
have
food
to
eat
have
cloth
to
wear
but
my
heart
was
in
deep
frustration
and
had
much
hatre
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
shaping
my
thoughts
that
the
life
had
not
power
to
lift
me
from
the
miserable
conditions.after
long
long
time
the
climate
has
been
changed
to
more
warm
the
rivers
have
been
changed
to
more
polluted
the
hearts
of
many
people
have
been
changed
by
desire
for
money
to
be
vicious
my
god
has
given
me
the
enlight
that
if
you
can
comprehend
the
love
the
truth
you
can
have
sheft
below
the
sunshine
which
would
fill
you
and
warm
you
so
it
is
my
fortunation
I
can
get
the
hints
from
god
giving
me
the
truth
which
fattened
my
twisted
raods
in
the
mist
and
I
can
smile
happily
and
never
be
frustrated
again
Even
if
I
explain
the
understanding
of
love
and
truth
again
and
again
lots
of
people
still
had
lof
of
question
on
my
comprehension
about
the
thoughts
as
same
as
my
past.in
my
past
I
was
puzzled
intensifiedly
on
some
meaningful
words.some
people
said
to
me
the
words
wisdom
but
it
is
like
a
fool
who
can
not
distinguish
what
is
right
or
wrong
I
am
delayed
to
understand
the
truth
which
stumbled
my
existence
and
made
me
fall
to
hell.but
the
darkness
is
not
always
having
no
light
maybe
my
god
has
pity
on
me
one
day
I
found
thoughts
can
change
my
action
my
attitude
to
the
life
I
confronted
that
is
in
the
embarrassed
condition.after
I
have
been
changed
to
the
peace
life
by
the
fresh
way
of
thinking
I
can
in
confidence
make
a
conclusion
that
please
believing
in
the
god¡¯s
soul
that
tell
you
what
is
yours
what
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
this
world
worthy
pusuring
you
should
love
should
dent
the
suffering
you
have
got
and
smiling
in
the
darkness
stubborn
and
everyone
would
follow
the
regulations
rooted
in
your
heart
thinking
of
the
company
as
your
own
our
enterprise
would
be
promising.The
safety
and
service
is
the
crux
to
our
enterprise
we
must
strengthen
our
consciousness
to
keep
them
in
our
mind
and
do
our
best
to
support
it
VIRTUE
is
like
a
rich
stone
best
plain
set
and
surely
virtue
is
best
in
a
body
that
is
comely
though
not
of
delicate
features
and
that
hath
rather
dignity
of
presence
than
beauty
of
aspect
Neither
is
it
almost
seen
that
very
beautiful
persons
are
otherwise
of
great
virtue
as
if
nature
were
rather
busy
not
to
err
than
in
labor
to
produce
excellency
And
therefore
they
prove
accomplished
but
not
of
great
spirit
and
study
rather
behavior
than
virtue
But
this
holds
not
always
for
Augustus
Caesar
Titus
Vespasianus
Philip
le
Belle
of
France
Edward
the
Fourth
of
England
Alcibiades
of
Athens
Ismael
the
Sophy
of
Persia
were
all
high
and
great
spirits
and
yet
the
most
beautiful
men
of
their
times
In
beauty
that
of
favor
is
more
than
that
of
color
and
that
of
decent
and
gracious
motion
more
than
that
of
favor
That
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
cannot
express
no
nor
the
first
sight
of
the
life
There
is
no
excellent
beauty
that
hath
not
some
strangeness
in
the
proportion
A
man
cannot
tell
whether
Apelles
or
Albert
Durer
were
the
more
trifler
whereof
the
one
would
make
a
personage
by
geometrical
proportions
the
other
by
taking
the
best
parts
out
of
divers
faces
to
make
one
excellent
Such
personages
I
think
would
please
nobody
but
the
painter
that
made
them
Not
but
I
think
a
painter
may
make
a
better
face
than
ever
was
but
he
must
do
it
by
a
kind
of
felicity
as
a
musician
that
maketh
an
excellent
air
in
music
and
not
by
rule
A
man
shall
see
faces
that
if
you
examine
them
part
by
part
you
shall
find
never
a
good
and
yet
altogether
do
well
If
it
be
true
that
the
principal
part
of
beauty
is
in
decent
motion
certainly
it
is
no
marvel
though
persons
in
years
seem
many
times
more
amiable
pulchrorum
autumnus
pulcher
for
no
youth
can
be
comely
but
by
pardon
and
considering
the
youth
as
to
make
up
the
comeliness
Beauty
is
as
summer
fruits
which
are
easy
to
corrupt
and
cannot
last
and
for
the
most
part
it
makes
a
dissolute
youth
and
an
age
a
little
out
of
countenance
but
yet
certainly
again
if
it
light
well
it
maketh
virtue
shine
and
vices
blush
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
It
was
New
Year¡¯s
Night
An
aged
man
was
standing
at
a
window
He
raised
his
mournful
eyes
towards
the
deep
blue
sky
where
the
stars
were
floating
like
white
lilies
on
the
surface
of
a
clear
calm
lake
Then
he
cast
them
on
the
earth
where
few
more
hopeless
people
than
himself
now
moved
towards
their
certain
goal
the
tomb
He
had
already
passed
sixty
of
the
stages
leading
to
it
and
he
had
brought
from
his
journey
nothing
but
errors
and
remorse
Now
his
health
was
poor
his
mind
vacant
his
heart
sorrowful
and
his
old
age
short
of
comforts
The
days
of
his
youth
appeared
like
dreams
before
him
and
he
recalled
the
serious
moment
when
his
father
placed
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
roads
one
leading
to
a
peaceful
sunny
place
covered
with
flowers
fruits
and
resounding
with
soft
sweet
songs
the
other
leading
to
a
deep
dark
cave
which
was
endless
where
poison
flowed
instead
of
water
and
where
devils
and
poisonous
snakes
hissed
and
crawled
He
looked
towards
the
sky
and
cried
painfully
O
youth
return
O
my
father
place
me
once
more
at
the
entrance
to
life
and
I¡¯ll
choose
the
better
way
But
both
his
father
and
the
days
of
his
youth
had
passed
away
He
saw
the
lights
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
These
were
the
days
of
his
wasted
life
he
saw
a
star
fall
down
from
the
sky
and
disappeared
and
this
was
the
symbol
of
himself
His
remorse
which
was
like
a
sharp
arrow
struck
deeply
into
his
heart
Then
he
remembered
his
friends
in
his
childhood
who
entered
on
life
together
with
him
But
they
had
made
their
way
to
success
and
were
now
honoured
and
happy
on
this
New
Year¡¯s
Night
The
clock
in
the
high
church
tower
struck
and
the
sound
made
him
remember
his
parents
early
love
for
him
They
had
taught
him
and
prayed
to
God
for
his
good
But
he
chose
the
wrong
way
With
shame
and
grief
he
dared
no
longer
look
towards
that
heaven
where
his
father
lived
His
darkened
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
with
a
despairing
effort
he
burst
out
a
cry
Come
back
my
early
days
Come
back
And
his
youth
did
return
for
all
this
was
only
a
dream
which
he
had
on
New
Year¡¯s
Night
He
was
still
young
though
his
faults
were
real
he
had
not
yet
entered
the
deep
dark
cave
and
he
was
still
free
to
walk
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
peaceful
and
sunny
land
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
again
until
it
was
firm
enough
As
time
passed
there
were
other
rules
to
learn
Always
do
your
best.""Do
it
now.""Never
lie
And
most
importantly
"You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
By
my
teens
he
wasn't
telling
me
what
to
do
anymore
which
was
scary
and
heady
at
the
same
time
He
provided
perspective
not
telling
me
what
was
around
the
great
corner
of
life
but
letting
me
know
there
was
a
lot
more
than
just
today
and
the
next
which
I
hadn't
thought
of
One
day
I
realize
now
there
was
a
change
I
wasn't
trying
to
please
him
so
much
as
I
was
trying
to
impress
him
I
never
asked
him
to
come
to
my
football
games
He
had
a
high-pressure
career
and
it
meant
driving
through
most
of
Friday
night
But
for
all
the
big
games
when
I
looked
over
at
the
sideline
there
was
that
familiar
fedora
And
by
God
did
the
opposing
team
captain
ever
get
a
firm
handshake
and
a
gaze
he
would
remember
Then
a
school
fact
contradicted
something
he
said
Impossible
that
he
could
be
wrong
but
there
it
was
in
the
book
These
accumulated
over
time
along
with
personal
experiences
to
buttress
my
own
developing
sense
of
values
And
I
could
tell
we
had
each
taken
our
own
perfectly
normal
paths
I
began
to
see
too
his
blind
spots
his
prejudices
and
his
weaknesses
I
never
threw
these
up
at
him
He
hadn't
to
me
and
anyway
he
seemed
to
need
protection
I
stopped
asking
his
advice
the
experiences
he
drew
from
no
longer
seemed
relevant
to
the
decisions
I
had
to
make
He
volunteered
advice
for
a
while
But
then
in
more
recent
years
politics
and
issues
gave
way
to
talk
of
empty
errands
and
always
to
ailments
From
his
bed
he
showed
me
the
many
sores
and
scars
on
his
misshapen
body
and
all
the
bottles
for
medicine
Sometimes
he
confided
I
would
just
like
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
not
wake
up
After
much
thought
and
practice
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
one
night
last
winter
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
and
remembered
for
an
instant
those
terrifying
dark
holes
in
another
house
35
years
before
I
told
my
fatherhow
much
I
loved
him
I
described
all
the
things
people
were
doing
for
him
But
I
said
he
kept
eating
poorly
hiding
in
his
room
and
violating
the
doctor's
orders
No
amount
of
love
could
make
someone
else
care
about
life
I
said
it
was
a
two-way
street
He
wasn't
doing
his
best
The
decision
was
his
He
said
he
knew
how
hard
my
words
had
been
to
say
and
how
proud
he
was
of
me
I
had
the
best
teacher
I
said
You
can
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
He
smiled
a
little
And
we
shook
hands
firmly
for
the
last
time
Several
days
later
at
about
4
A.M
my
mother
heard
Dad
shuffling
about
their
dark
room
I
have
some
things
I
have
to
do
he
said
He
paid
a
bundle
of
bills
He
composed
for
my
mother
a
long
list
of
legal
and
financial
what-to-do's
in
case
of
emergency
And
he
wrote
me
a
note
Then
he
walked
back
to
his
bed
and
laid
himself
down
He
went
to
sleep
naturally
And
he
did
not
wake
up
Those
who
still
linger
on
the
entrance
of
life
hesitating
to
choose
the
bright
road
remember
that
when
years
are
passed
and
your
feet
stumble
on
the
dark
mountains
you
will
cry
bitterly
but
in
vain
O
youth
return
Oh
give
me
back
my
early
days
Many
provincial
Party
committees
have
created
detailed
policies
to
improve
their
working
style
as
required
by
the
country's
core
leadership
With
these
measures
Party
authorities
are
attempting
to
get
closer
to
the
public
experts
said
We
have
seen
lots
of
fresh
working
styles
from
the
newly
elected
Party
leaders
such
as
fewer
cliches
at
conferences
no
traffic
controls
during
inspection
tours
and
so
on
said
Zhu
Lijia
a
professor
of
public
administration
research
at
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Governance
But
Party
authorities
should
enhance
supervision
and
those
who
violate
regulations
should
be
punished
he
added
In
a
10-item
regulation
issued
on

Xinjiang
Uygur
autonomous

said
that
reception

be
limited
to
less
than
45
minutes
in
government
agencies
According
to
the
regulation
the
autonomous

Party's
working
style
cutting
extravagance
and
bureaucracy

the
eight
measures
officials
should
reduce

Many
provincial-level

and
main
Party
leaders
a
term
that
usually

the
Beijing
municipal
Party
committee
said
on
Dec
19
in
a
document
implementing

MOSCOW
Dec
26
Xinhua
The
Russian
Federation
Council
or
the
upper
house
of
the
parliament
approved
on
Wednesday
a
bill
which
would
imposes
entry
bans
on
U.S
citizens
who
have
allegedly
committed
crimes
against
Russians
abroad

persons
involved
in
abduction
or
illegal
imprisonment
of
Russians
as
well
as
those
implicated
in
abuse
of
adopted
Russian
children
The
bill
is
widely
believed
a
retaliation
for
the
U.S
Magnitsky
Act
which
was
passed
by
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
in

of
Sergei
Magnitsky
a
lawyer
who
died
in

in
a
Moscow
jail
after

Dima
Yakovlev
bill
which
also
bans
U.S

Russian-born
toddler
who
died
in
the
United
States
due
to
his

the
Moscow
police
have

building
who
were

Konstantin
Dolgov
the
Russian
Foreign
Ministry's
commissioner
for
human
rights
commented
on
Wednesday
the
bill
banning
the
U.S
citizens
to
adopt
Russian
orphans
does
not
contradict
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
UNCRC
The
high-ranking
diplomat
said
The
Convention
contains
no
binding
norms
regarding
international
children
adoption
adding
that
on
the
opposite
it
encourages
the
member
states
to
prioritize
the
national
means
of
children
adoption
The
UNCRC
which
grants
all
children
and
young
people
a
comprehensive
set
of

was

Members
of
the
Standing
Committee
of
National
People's
Congress
made
the
suggestion
at
a
panel
discussion
on
a
State
Council
report
about
land
administration
which
was
submitted
to
the
top
legislature
for
deliberation
Lu
Yongxiang
vice
chairman
of
the
NPC
Standing
Committee
suggested
the
government
invest
more
money
to
upgrade
medium
or
lower-yield
farmland
which
accounts
for
about
70
percent
of
the
country's
arable
land
Efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
soil
and
irrigation
and
restore
polluted
soil
in
order
to
boost
both
agricultural
production
and
ecological
benefits
he
said
China
applies
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
Users
shall
be
responsible
for
reclaiming
the

area
and
quality
of
cultivated
land
they
use
for
construction
of
non-agricultural
projects
the
Land
Administration
Law
stipulates
Wang
Yunkun
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
voiced
his
doubts
on
the
quality
of
compensated
land
and
suggested
the
NPC
and
relevant
departments
of
the
State
Council
or
Cabinet
conduct
comprehensive
checks
nationwide
Farmland
is
not
easy
to
cultivate
It
usually
takes
dozens
or
hundreds
of
years
he
said
Hou
Jianguo
an
NPC
Standing
Committee
member
said
People
should
realize
that
high-yield
farmland
is
a
precious
resource
that
is
nonrenewable
Hou
urged
the
government
to
strictly
implement
the
principle
of
reclaiming
the
same
area
of
land
as
is
used
He
added
Some
special
protection
zones
should
be
set
up
to
better
protect
high-yield
arable
land
China's
per
capita
arable
land
is
only
about
1.35
mu
lower
than
half
of
the
world
average
High-yield
farmland
only
accounts
for
30
percent
of
the
total
arable
land
and
the
country
has
little
backup
resources
available
according
to
the
report
To
ensure
grain
security
the
country
has
drawn
a
red
line
of
1.8
billion
mu
120
million
hectares
as
the
official
minimum
of
arable
land
to
feed
the
world's
largest
population
However
with
rapid
urbanization
and
massive
infrastructure
construction
the
country
is
already
edging
dangerously
close
to
the
tipping
point
with
just
1.82
billion
mu
available
as
of
2011
figures

set

Tmall

have
gradually

of

in

a
jump
of
95.8
percent
year-on-year
according
to
an
Analysys
International
report
Over
the
past
six
months
the
sector
witnessed
the
most
furious
competition
it
has
ever
seen
with
price
wars
in
mid-August
and
a
series
of
year-end
promotions
Intensified
competition
among
large
platforms
will
further
narrow
retail
profit
margins
However
it
also
helped
set
the
tone
for
the
nation's
B2C
sector
with
large
shopping
platforms
set
to
dominate
the

in

did
not
say
how
much

share
the

in

Although
their

In

the
report
estimated
that
the
growth
rate
of
China's

industry
is
set
to
decline
in
the

partly
because

will

was

admitted
to

in

because
of
abdominal
pain
but
released
the
following
day
after
a
keyhole
examination
showed
there

since
then
in
another
home
in
Qunu
his
ancestral
village
in
the
impoverished
Eastern
Cape

His
poor
health
has
prevented
him
from
making

in

A
religious
scholar
and
Shari¡®a
law
official
in
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
leadership
in
the
Aleppo
area
the
35-year-old
had
a
ready
answer
for
what
he
thought
of
the
U.S
designating
his
Islamist
group
a
terrorist
organization
It¡¯s
not
a
problem
he
said
We
know
the
West
and
its
oppressive
ways
We
know
the
oppression
of
the
U.N
Security
Council
the
lies
of
the
international
community
It¡¯s
not
news
This
means
nothing
to
us
The
designation
officially
announced
on
Dec.11
lists
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
an
alias
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
and
says
that
since
November
2011
the
group
has
claimed
responsibility
for
nearly
600
terrorist
attacks
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
Syrians
The
group
was
unknown
until
late
January
2012
when
it
announced
its
formation
although
Abu
Adnan
admits
that
it
was
active
for
months
before
then
In
the
months
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
effective
fighting
forces
against
President
Bashar
Assad
undertaking
some
of
the
most
audacious
attacks
against
the
regime
Little
is
known
about
the
religiously
conservative
secretive
group
except
for
a
mysterious
leader
and
the
fact
that
it
now
wants
to
establish
an
Islamic
state
But
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
vaunted
discipline
and
reputation
on
the
battlefield
among
other
fighters
even
secular-minded
ones
is
growing
in
line
with
the
boldness
of
its
attacks
and
many
young
men
are
seeking
to
join
it
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
differ
ideologically
from
other
Syrian
Salafi
Islamist
groups
like
Ahrar
al-Sham
and
Liwa
al-Tawhid
We
are
all
Sunni
Muslims
says
Abu
Adnan
so
there
is
no
difference
The
difference
he
suggested
was
in
the
type
of
fighter
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
prepared
to
accept
into
its
ranks
We
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
individual
fighter
we
are
concerned
with
quality
not
quantity
Smokers
need
not

A
potential
recruit
must
undertake
a
10-day
religious-training
course
to
ascertain
his
understanding
of
religion
his
morals
his
reputation
A
15-to-20-day
military-training
program
follows
That
the
U.S
has
now
made
an
overt
enemy
of
this
group
only
makes
it
seem
more
attractive
to
many
who
have
long
viewed
U.S
intentions
in
the
region
with
suspicion
War
can
make
strange
bedfellows
but
Washington
has
clearly
calculated
that
this
group
is
too
dangerous
to
court
The
trouble
is
many
in
the
Syrian
opposition
think
otherwise
It
took
weeks
to
set
up
an
interview
with
Abu
Adnan
whose
role
in
the
organization
was
independently
confirmed
by
several
Syrian
jihadi
sources
An
earlier
meeting
was
canceled
for
security
reasons
after
a
vehicle
he
was
traveling
in
was
targeted
by
a
warplane
The
air
strike
narrowly
missed
the
car
He
and
his
colleagues
viewed
it
as
an
assassination
attempt
believing
their
location
was
pinpointed
by
an
electronic
tagger
attached
to
their
vehicle
although
nobody
actually
saw
the
alleged
device
The
interview
took
place
in
a
town
in
northern
Syria
in
the
countryside
outside
Aleppo
I
was
not
blindfolded
nor
subjected
to
a
physical
security
check
I
was
picked
up
at
a
northern
Syria
border
post
driven
for
about
15
minutes
inside
the
country
before
the
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
a
black
pickup
truck
waiting
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
empty
stretch
of
road
There
were
three
men
in
the
vehicle
including
Abu
Adnan
who
silently
approached
the
car
I
was
in
and
sat
in
the
backseat
He
did
not
introduce
himself
until
I
asked
who
he
was
later
We
drove
to
a
small
cold
concrete
room
with
a
tiny
window
that
barely
let
in
any
light
from
an
already
overcast
sky
We
sat
among
boxes
of
long-life
milk
and
bags
of
blankets
and
winter
clothes
waiting
to
be
distributed
Our
host
the
driver
tried
to
start
a
portable
gas
heater
but
there
was
no
gas
America
has
called
us
terrorists
because
it
says
that
some
of
our
tactics
bear
the
fingerprints
of
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
like
our
explosives
and
the
car
bombs
Abu
Adnan
said
his
breath
condensing
as
he
spoke
We
are
not
like
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
we
are
not
of
them
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
count
Syrian
veterans
of
the
Iraq
war
among
its
numbers
men
who
bring
expertise
especially
the
manufacture
of
improvised
explosive
devices
IEDs
to
the
front
in
Syria
Still
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
not
the
only
rebel
outfit
to
use
IEDs
and
other
groups
some
so-called
moderates
operating
under
the
loose
umbrella
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
FSA
have
also
allegedly
used
suicide
bombers
who
were
either
willing
or
unwilling
i.e
prisoners
Like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
a
number
of
other
Islamist
groups
also
want
to
install
an
Islamic
state
in
Syria
while
even
secular
rebel
units
increasingly
speak
in
ugly
sectarian
terms
that
demonize
minorities
particularly
members
of
Assad¡¯s
Alawite
sect
Yet
only
Jabhat
al-Nusra¡¯s
tactics
were
designated
as
terrorist
by
a
U.S
administration
that
admits
it
is
still
trying
to
understand
the
various
armed
elements
in
the
Syrian
conflict
fueling
all
manner
of
theories
about
why
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
slapped
with
the
description
Also
why
time
the
announcement
just
as
rebels
as
a
whole
seem
to
have
gained
a
renewed
momentum
The
key
it
seems
is
the
alleged
links
to
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq.If
the
designation
was
intended
to
isolate
Jabhat
al-Nusra
it
appears
to
have
done
the
opposite
and
actually
enhanced
its
standing
and
reputation
among
some
Syrians
The
nationwide
protest
in
Syria
on
Dec
14
for
example
used
the
slogan
The
only
terrorism
in
Syria
is
Assad¡¯s
a
clear
rebuke
to
the
naming
Dozens
of
rebel
groups
have
publicly
declared
We
are
all
Jabhat
al-Nusra
while
even
the
leadership
of
the
political
opposition
in
exile
has
condemned
the
terrorist
label
Abu
Adnan
like
a
number
of
people
in
the
opposition
believes
the
designation
reveals
that
Washington
is
not
serious
about
removing
Assad
We
see
it
as
if
America
wants
to
give
the
regime
a
big
break
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
for
as
long
as
it
can
he
said
The
regime
has
been
practicing
terrorism
for
two
years
and
America
did
nothing
so
why
has
it
moved
quickly
against
a
fighting
force
on
the
ground
in
Syria
labeling
it
a
terrorist
organization
Has
it
forgotten
the
regime
At
the
core
of
this
thinking
is
the
notion
that
the
West
wants
to
retain
the
Israel-centric
status
quo
including
keeping
leaders
like
the
Assads
in
power
rather
than
risk
Islamists
coming
to
power
in
Damascus
President
Assad
and
his
late
father
and
predecessor
Hafez
Assad
ensured
that
the
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
the
Jewish
state
was
the
quietest
Arab-Israeli
front
line
for
decades
despite
the
dynasty¡¯s
fearsome
rhetoric
Some
rebels
think
the
designation
was
meant
to
foment
fitna
or
internal
divisions
within
the
already
fragmented
rebel
ranks
in
a
bid
to
dissipate
their
momentum
or
that
it
will
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
avoid
arming
Syrian
rebels
at
all
given
that
many
operations
are
joint
attacks
between
Islamist
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
secular
FSA
units
In
practical
terms
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
West
to
provide
weapons
to
select
groups
it
wants
to
work
with
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
the
weapons
would
not
also
end
up
in
the
hands
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
unless
it
expressly
wants
those
favored
groups
to
fight
the
Islamist
militia
group
In
any
case
Jabhat
al-Nusra
isn¡¯t
waiting
for
weapons
from
the
international
community
according
to
Abu
Adnan
A
recent
raid
on
a
regime
outpost
in
Daarat
Izze
in
the
Aleppan
countryside
secured
more
weapons
than
what
a
country
can
give
us
he
said
Foreign
fighters
were
also
a
source
of
support
both
physical
in
terms
of
their
presence
and
material
funds
In
the
meantime
the
organization
maintains
a
firm
grip
on
information
about
itself
disseminating
statements
and
videos
via
its
media
wing
al-Manarah
al-Bayda
its
material
is
promoted
online
by
Shamoukh
al-Islam
a
leading
pro-al-Qaeda
forum
Its
members
do
not
generally
grant
media
interviews
We
don¡¯t
care
about
the
press
It¡¯s
not
a
priority
to
us
Abu
Adnan
said
Our
priority
is
to
fight
the
regime
If
we
film
an
operation
we
film
it
it¡¯s
not
important
but
for
many
other
groups
the
filming
is
a
priority
it
helps
them
get
funding
Jabhat
al-Nusra
is
headed
by
a
man
who
uses
the
nom
de
guerre
of
Abu
Mohammad
al-Golani
Golani
is
a
reference
to
Syria¡¯s
Golan
Heights
occupied
by
Israel
The
U.S
Treasury
Department
has
also
slapped
financial
sanctions
against
two
men
it
believes
are
senior
leaders
in
the
militia
group
Maysar
Ali
Musa
Abdallah
al-Juburi
and
Anas
Hasan
Khattab
Recent
media
reports
also
mention
one
Mustafa
Abdel-Latif
also
known
as
Abu
Anas
al-Sahaba
as
the
new
emir
or
leader
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
A
Jordanian
national
al-Sahaba
is
the
brother-in-law
of
the
late
al-Qaeda
in
Iraq
leader
Abu
Mousab
al-Zarqawi
Abu
Adnan
would
not
disclose
any
information
about
the
men
named
by
the
Treasury
Department
and
said
al-Golani
remained
the
Jabhat
leader
Al-Golani¡¯s
real
identity
remains
a
well-kept
secret
even
to
the
leaders
of
other
similar
Islamist
militant
groups
in
Syria
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
leaders
of
the
Salafi
groups
Ahrar
al-Sham
Suqoor
al-Sham
Liwa
al-Islam
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
several
other
units
to
discuss
the
creation
of
a
Syria-wide
pan-Islamist
coalition
al-Golani
kept
his
face
covered
throughout
the
proceedings
according
to
a
participant
He
was
introduced
by
the
Jabhat
leaders
in
the
provinces
of
Idlib
and
Aleppo
who
vouched
for
his
identity
but
al-Golani
offered
no
information
about
himself
He
knew
everything
about
each
one
of
us
the
participant
said
how
long
we¡¯d
been
in
the
fight
our
personal
backgrounds
how
long
we¡¯d
spent
in
prison
before
the
revolution
everything
Dressed
in
jeans
a
light
gray
sweater
a
black
leather
jacket
and
black
loafers
Abu
Adnan
was
calm
polite
but
clearly
uncomfortable
with
several
lines
of
questioning
particularly
about
the
group¡¯s
numbers
which
he
refused
to
divulge
and
details
of
its
structure
These
have
the
spirit
of
an
intelligence
agency¡¯s
questions
he
said
Jabhat
al-Nusra
Abu
Adnan
claims
has
extended
its
presence
throughout
Syria
Each
region
has
an
overall
leader
a
military
commander
and
a
Shari¡®a
leader
he
said
In
the
past
Jabhat
members
largely
kept
to
themselves
mingling
with
other
fighters
but
otherwise
not
interacting
with
the
local
communities
in
which
they
were
based
and
not
seeking
to
forcefully
impose
their
conservative
Islamic
views
on
them
unlike
members
of
Ahrar
al-Sham
for
example
which
have
had
run-ins
with
locals
who
have
rejected
their
attempts
to
ban
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
their
communities
But
in
the
past
month
or
so
that
has
slowly
changed
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
one
of
several
groups
that
in
late
November
rejected
the
freshly
anointed
Western-backed
group
of
Syrian
political
exiles
baptized
as
the
National
Coalition
Instead
the
militia
group
declared
its
intention
to
form
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
That
statement
was
broadly
rejected
by
many
members
of
the
Syrian
opposition
but
Abu
Adnan
says
his
group
will
continue
to
fight
for
it
Those
in
exile
think
that
we
will
scare
the
West
and
Europe
if
we
are
an
Islamic
state
We
are
not
an
Islamic
state
now
and
what
have
these
countries
offered
over
the
past
year
and
nine
months
Why
has
the
West
for
a
year
and
nine
months
not
given
anything
to
the
revolution
Minorities
he
said
had
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
state
The
Prophet
peace
be
upon
him
had
a
Jewish
neighbor
he
said
Whoever
has
not
oppressed
or
participated
in
the
harming
of
the
people
his
rights
are
his
rights
and
his
duties
are
his
duties
But
those
who
had
blood
on
their
hands
whether
minorities
or
not
would
be
shown
no
mercy
Abu
Adnan
defended
several
recent
videos
including
one
of
a
member
of
Jabhat
al-Nusra
gunning
down
unarmed
regime
loyalists
We
detained
them
lined
them
up
and
killed
them
They
were
fighters
fighting
us
So
this
is
terrorism
but
we
forget
that
there
is
an
entire
state
that
has
terrorized
people
for
40
years
he
said
He
said
that
if
anything
Jabhat
al-Nusra
was
keeping
itself
in
check
Many
of
the
people
who
are
wanted
by
us
who
we
have
scores
to
settle
with
very
important
people
are
present
in
Turkey
in
areas
close
to
the
border
we
can
easily
reach
them
It
would
be
very
easy
for
us
but
we
won¡¯t
do
this
and
yet
they
still
call
us
terrorists
We
are
fighting
in
Syria
and
who
are
we
fighting
The
security
forces
the
shabiha
proregime
thugs
also
listed
as
terrorists
by
the
U.S
and
those
who
help
the
regime
At
the
same
time
as
announcing
plans
for
an
Islamic
state
in
Aleppo
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
begun
undertaking
relief
efforts
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
city
it
is
based
in
seeking
a
stronger
foothold
in
the
local
community
even
though
paradoxically
like
many
rebel
groups
operating
in
Aleppo
its
fighters
are
largely
not
from
the
city
It
has
distributed
much
needed
supplies
of
petrol
diesel
and
flour
to
bakeries
We
are
keeping
the
price
of
bread
at
15
lira
about
21
U.S
cents
which
was
its
true
price
Abu
Adnan
said
adding
that
transgressors
would
be
punished
according
to
Shari¡®a
Jabhat
al-Nusra
has
also
thus
far
avoided
indiscriminate
civilian
casualties
That¡¯s
not
to
say
that
Jabhat
al-Nusra
does
not
have
fierce
critics
especially
within
rebel
circles
In
addition
to
its
civilian
detractors
many
more
secular-minded
fighters
are
wary
of
the
group¡¯s
social
conservatism
but
insist
that
its
brand
of
ultraconservative
Islam
will
not
find
a
home
in
any
post-Assad
Syria
These
fighters
often
say
that
they
will
deal
with
conservative
groups
like
Jabhat
al-Nusra
later
but
that
right
now
they
need
them
in
the
fight
against
Assad
Other
rebels
view
Jabhat
al-Nusra
as
a
transient
jihadi
group
that
will
move
onto
foreign
fronts
like
Afghanistan
or
Gaza
after
the
fall
of
Assad
Abu
Adnan
smirked
when
asked
to
comment
about
such
sentiments
especially
by
fellow
Sunni
fighters
whom
he
dismissed
as
the
brainwashed
He
repeated
that
the
idea
that
we
are
a
global
organization
or
that
we
have
some
other
goal
elsewhere
after
the
fall
is
not
true
He
was
emphatic
We
are
Syrians
He
admitted
that
we
also
have
foreigners
who
came
from
other
countries
but
he
explained
that
is
because
the
wounds
in
the
Arab
lands
are
the
same
wound
and
the
oppression
is
the
same
oppression
A
minute
I
always
feel
so
long
Think
of
me
and
your
chance
Less
and
less
as
if
by
the
end
of
life
We
separate
with
each
other
The
world
of
two
people
each
other
again
A
minute
I'm
drunk
wine
a
few
times
The
evening
of
that
day
I'm
a
night
did
not
return
you
want
to
A
minute
Appear
in
front
of
you
you
want
me
to
repent
But
time
constraints
no
waiting
a
minute
Is
the
morning
you
find
I'm
a
night
that
night
Who
knows
in
the
noon
time
I
am
the
soft
bed
happy
to
sleep
But
you
have
to
use
a
minute
Wake
me
up
the
rumble
of
the
scolded
I
feel
very
feel
shy
When
I
want
to
take
a
minute
to
make
up
But
you
never
give
me
a
chance
And
you
say
we
are
the
best
choice
to
leave
I
used
a
few
years
time
Build
a
charming
scenery
wall
And
now
you
say
collapse
will
collapse
I'm
unwilling
heart
want
to
take
a
minute
To
redeem
my
fault
I
beg
you
said
to
me
Not
I
do
not
give
you
the
opportunity
But
given
the
opportunity
you
have
to
cherish
So
we
each
other
to
leave
for
good
That
night
the
minutes
But
it
doesn't
make
you
took
from
my
dreams
May
the
minute
for
you
Is
already
in
the
past
for
me
A
minute
is
an
indelible
scar
Forever
in
your
heart
the
brand
mark
The
nine
seven
half
of
the
year
I
graduated
from
the
primary
school
took
more
than
two
months
holiday
oneself
in
boring
boring
nothing
for
me
to
do
Probably
because
I
was
in
primary
school
has
over
two
times
the
level
or
that
I
was
in
the
primary
school
stage
without
ambition
my
result
difference
make
them
disappointed
disappointed
again
in
helpless
situation
teachers
do
not
stay
in
my
class
From
the
beginning
to
repeat
things
because
be
informed
parents
I
have
the
opinion
very
much
but
that
s
not
for
me
to
say
but
parents
and
teachers
say
so
in
the
two
years
younger
than
I
classmates
together
side
by
side
I
was
very
uncomfortable
psychological
also
feel
very
guilty
Only
this
guilt
and
inner
pain
no
one
can
imagine
Then
to
the
junior
high
school
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
neighborhood
folks
have
advised
me
not
to
read
so
I
went
to
town
to
work
I
seem
to
be
somewhat
unwilling
heart
did
not
listen
to
their
opinions
and
think
of
reading
mind
reading
do
not
know
what
may
I
feel
lonely
stay
in
the
quiet
village
households
seem
dismal
alone
let
me
feel
very
afraid
so
I
read
no
matter
how
bad
but
also
to
the
nine
year
compulsory
education
school
But
I
think
the
day
time
is
long
etc
several
day
has
not
yet
come
psychological
anxious
Sometimes
I'm
afraid
aunt
nagging
uncle's
house
did
not
dare
to
go
have
been
at
home
with
And
from
that
time
I
love
to
read
a
Book
habits
mother's
good
at
saying
you
read
a
book
are
admitted
to
a
university
so
you
really
go
to
read
a
book
you
don't
read
I
was
so
mom
a
nag
well
I
hate
to
take
all
of
the
book
to
burn
My
graduation
exam
is
over
a
long
time
I
didn't
know
how
to
grade
their
own
have
been
waiting
when
my
anxiety
to
fifth
days
at
the
same
time
the
junior
middle
school
admission
notice
to
can
not
write
performance
I
can
not
find
out
their
performance
is
bad
or
good
not
over
the
admission
notice
I
was
happy
but
when
the
notice
it
but
found
that
there
was
no
money
at
home
for
me
to
read
and
I
feel
it
This
day
Friday
daddy
go
out
as
I
gather
books
go
home
and
left
me
and
my
mother
two
Father
outside
money
very
hard
a
week
later
did
not
wait
for
the
dad
who
come
back
home
I
was
boring
occasionally
also
help
mother
do
some
housework
but
most
of
the
time
I
am
a
person
sits
on
the
bed
or
on
the
wheelchair
When
I
was
home
to
sit
to
uncle
home
to
flow
because
the
uncle's
path
is
the
only
way
which
must
be
passed
on
the
junior
high
school
so
when
the
school
in
the
school
I'll
be
watching
them
back
and
forth
it
seems
that
I'm
reading
way
does
not
give
up
Father
borrow
money
did
not
come
back
but
the
family
tattle
and
prate
much
rise
when
aunt
in
my
ears
ago
often
nag
daddy
thing
I
feel
creepy
why
is
it
so
Dad
why
Dad
You
come
back
You
come
back
quickly
I
prefer
not
to
read
will
not
let
you
be
such
grievances
such
insults
Dad
Dad
What
are
you
Why
are
they
so
say
you
I
have
been
to
have
been
waiting
for
his
return
Aunt
said
your
father
too
do
bad
name
that
he
do
it
really
lost
your
face
For
a
start
I
don't
know
what
happened
the
mood
is
very
heavy
asked
aunt
how
Is
there
anything
so
so
serious
Aunt
aggravated
by
an
angry
tone
said
your
father
outside
in
order
to
give
you
borrow
books
first
to
your
aunt's
house
he
said
the
home
to
buy
cattle
need
to
borrow
money
so
aunt
to
know
no
such
thing
so
don't
borrow
To
the
ancient
city
of
leaf
Tingjia
your
father's
friends
said
to
buy
chemical
fertilizer
to
borrow
a
little
money
Tingjia
leaves
no
he
will
go
to
your
grandma's
house
to
you
two
uncle's
house
to
borrow
your
dad
said
is
to
build
a
house
your
uncle
happened
to
encounter
village
grow
there
ask
he
once
topic
was
exposed
he
had
to
go
to
Ningbo
and
the
town
of
Evergreen
s
aunt
s
home
to
borrow
they
have
had
to
go
to
Shangjie
discussed
In
fact
I
was
really
want
to
ask
why
he
did
know
go
to
Ningbo
to
evergreen
all
be
crystal
clear
isn't
he
is
immortal
But
I
think
if
I
really
ask
those
words
do
not
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
again
I
heard
a
few
times
she
simply
said
you
don't
read
simply
go
out
work
I
thought
if
Dad
comes
back
I
can't
read
but
sometimes
I
am
unwilling
heart
no
matter
what
was
advised
in
the
school
I
had
a
few
lessons
can
comfort
my
soul
As
for
the
aunt's
words
I
don't
want
to
hear
but
also
do
not
want
to
use
it
The
school
school
for
several
days
Dad
Don't
see
at
that
time
I
was
a
little
worried
but
those
tattle
and
prate
is
not
stopped
but
also
the
diffusion
constant
at
While
I
thought
in
my
mind
my
father
come
back
and
side
wanted
dad
to
lend
money
to
come
back
I
can
take
a
good
read
I
do
not
want
to
give
up
all
of
a
sudden
but
to
no
avail
since
the
tattle
and
prate
my
heart
was
tortured
to
death
Mom
In
addition
to
complaining
that
father
outside
sometimes
also
want
to
talk
to
scold
me
maybe
she
more
recently
than
I
was
upset
so
she
wants
to
say
I
she
said
to
me
and
I
don't
chew
sound
One
day
I
went
to
his
aunt's
house
because
the
boring
to
my
aunt's
house
behind
the
bamboo
inside
to
digging
up
bamboo
shoots
when
I
really
dig
vigorously
suddenly
heard
the
mother's
cry
I
came
down
to
see
his
aunt
said
Daddy
things
let
s
lose
face
so
my
mother
sometimes
hard
to
explain
for
oneself
sometimes
feel
helpless
because
she
feels
she
jumped
into
the
the
Yellow
River
wash
not
clear
so
she
felt
wronged
cry
In
fact
say
mother
instigated
is
possible
the
key
is
my
own
request
forcing
the
father
in
the
back
of
the
eternal
infamy
to
say
in
the
final
analysis
is
my
fault
so
I
ought
to
I
heard
my
mother
weeping
I
also
feel
very
sad
This
a
few
days
later
mother's
mood
has
not
been
good
if
not
more
I
see
my
mother
like
this
is
very
worried
After
a
few
days
of
school
another
week
has
passed
I
also
miss
dad
Don't
know
Dad

doing
may
be
I
worry
most
X

on
the
evening
the
sun
nearly
down
hill
Dad
came
back
I
go
first
call
dad
like
my
father
and
several
years
not

meet
such
a
My
father
from
his
pocket
and
took
out
three
hundred
yuan
in
cash
for
me
to
go
to
school
but
this
money
is
only
a
fraction
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
books
she
in
the
presence
of
outsiders
say
uncle
s
contribution
but
not
all
because
I
have
three
hundred
yuan
to
make
books
uncle
didn't
go
with
me
in
the
said
dad
before
he
has
not
called
me
to
junior
high
school
but
a
three
again
three
advised
me
to
give
up
reading
now
papa
got
money
made
a
part
of
my
books
I
read
to
say
to
their
credit
is
a
little
exaggerated
Father
left
home
also
no
rest
was
mother
shouted
did
mother's
grievance
venting
gas
while
the
father
was
annoyed
do
not
know
to
whom
to
tell
he

Mother
said

The

Oh
So

Dad
shouted
who
said
that
To
who
said
that
You

me
a
call
My
accusers
Mother
said
without
confrontation

village
has
spread
to
open
You

You're
so

Dad
said
Mother
said
your
sister-in-law
also
said
do
not
believe
you
can
go
and
ask
him
do
their
own
things
to
know
Later
my
father
also
do
not
know
to
have
to
confront
this
thing
Buleerle
But
the
father
and
mother
are
very
long
time
had
not
spoken
always
keep
silence
state
I
do
because
my
father
helped
me
to
borrow
money
I
also
began
on
the
junior
high
school
In
the
spring
of
1999
I
in
the
middle
of
a
year
and
a
half
later
I
will
quietly
leave
leave
the
dream
of
M
school
in
junior
high
school
Ah
Ah
The
deeply
cherish
the
memory
of
an
old
school
I
deeply
and
it
goodbye
away
from
its
footprints
returned
to
the
top
of
a
person
to
a
dull-witted
depressed
I
at
that
time
began
to
slowly
negative
until
I
am
downhearted
in
the
sleepless
at
night
I
become
vegetative
speak
not
walk
in
the
vegetative
In
spring
the
gentle
spring
is
not
far
away
like
lava
hot
summer
nor
recently
my
heart
began
to
fall
apart
my
heart
starts
to
dismay
At
that
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
have
the
Spring
Festival
after
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
to
uncle
also
asked
my
mother
the
same
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
angry
with
me
they
look
down
on
me
so
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
them
but
they
are
my
parents
my
parents
siblings
I
sometimes
might
be
answered
them
before
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
mental
preparation
Must
bear
their
blame
or
that
they
are
for
my
criticism
Whenever
I
go
to
uncle's
home
or
relatives
I
will
have
some
concerns
or
is
afraid
of
something
But
soon
half
nearly
ended
greeted
May
is
hot
very
so
stay
at
home
for
too
long
you
feel
so
lonely
and
boring
parents
also
I
have
no
job
but
feel
puzzled
think
it
over
and
over
again
had
no
friends
who
can
help
me
introduce
then
find
the
parents
remember
my
cousin
D
s
so
that
when
they
think
of
commissioned
sister-in-law
R's
called
D
took
me
to
the
city
to
work
F
F

located
on
the
edge
of
the
Fuchun
River
the
most
difficult
beautiful
county

also
my
hometown

administrative
center
Although
the
city
as
it
is
my
most
beautiful
dream
also
is
I
most
look
forward
to
come
to
one
of
the
city
but
because
life
economically
not
rich
or
because
I
was
in
the
city
without
known
relatives
so
only
stayed
in
the
countryside
most
lifetime
until
since
junior
high
school
lost

I
forced
to
quit

but
in
the
country
for
half
a
year
have
the
honor
to
the
D
s
lead
I
first
came
to
the
city
to
work
Since
D
s
hear
my
boring
at
home
after
the
state
he
was
in
the
very
next
day
morning
speeding
and
returned
to
his
hometown
urged
me
to
go
to
the
city
to
do
odd
jobs
because
I
had
no
idea
nor
promise
or
promises
probably
at
that
time
I
have
been
in
the
dream
of
the
life
in
the
city
there's
nothing
to
refuse
the
And
in
that
day
in
the
evening
mother
to
prepare
my
luggage

kerosene
lamp
she
gave
me
mending

while
sewing
clothes
of
a
hole
while
another
nag
told
me
A
Cheng
You

never
been
to
the
city

must
listen
to
your
cousin's
arrangement
don't
go
out
on
a
night
out
that
will
make
your
brother
worry
will
let
us
worry
there
is
the
question
of
your
life
must
be
well
orderly
and
you
wear
and
health
must
be
kept
clean
and
relaxed
or
your
big
brother
and
friends
will
look
down
upon
you
or
hate
you
I
said
oh
Know
My
father
said
you
know
now
but
really
to
the
city
after
you
is
it
right
Our
words
as
unheeded
advice
that
an
inlet
and
an
outlet
to
forget
about
and
do
I
hope
you
not
if
you
so
dad
wouldn't
want
to
control
you
The
night
his
father
for
the
first
time
to
drink
is
also
the
first
time
that
I
drank
tincture
MOET
drunk
I
in
the
night
imperceptibly
in
wheezing
to
sleep
Early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
I
also
in
outdoor
breathe
fresh
air
waiting
for
mother
made
breakfast
eat
a
good
meal
with
my
parents
goodbye
as
D
s
brother
came
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
city
to
work
together
Mother
sent
me
on
the
road
or
a
thousand
enjoin
enjoin
repeat
last
night
to
say
to
me
Dad
didn't
say
anything
but
he
was
from
his
own
pocket
to
take
out
five
hundred
yuan
in
cash
to
my
hands
I
do
when
running
D
will
give
the
money
back
to
his
father
said
A
Cheng
the
money
I
use
to
think
of
a
way
so
little
money
of
your
own
expenses
buy
chemical
fertilizer
also
can
Dad
said
so
how
can
I
Or
accept
it
D's
said
rest
assured
With
me
I
will
bless
her
I
will
give
him
his
money
saved
in
the
home
My
father
put
the
money
back
pocket
looking
down
the
hill
I
looked
back
at
my
father
also
forgot
about
my
mother
sometimes
I
feel
tears
the
mood
also
gradually
injury
fierce
later
I
walked
toward
the
downhill
path
go
on
Let's
go
The
downhill
road
seems
particularly
rough
particularly
rugged
I
had
to
calm
down
it
was
a
hard
hard
from
suffering
situation
let
me
feel
uneasy
My
back
pack
baggage
on
another
one-way
road
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
I
said
to
myself
since
I
have
to
go
to
town
to
work
I
should
relax
the
mind
will
go
to
why
should
so
be
reluctant
to
part
The
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
stream
I
in
the
water
side
looked
seems
to
me
that
here
was
the
last
miss
that
my
heart
is
full
of
hope
full
of
ideals
is
my
nostalgia
reminds
me
of
the
beauty
of
my
hometown
As
tears
like
springs
that
my
surging
mood
as
in
heaven
so
here
swear
resolutely
obey
D's
command
I
went
to
Lake
source
direction
to
horse
sword
shift
car
went
straight
to
the
F
town
Go
forward
with
great
strength
and
vigour
to
the
F
city
F
City
we
in
the
long-distance
passenger
station
of
the
car
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
city
I
think
it's
great
it
is
because
I
first
saw
the
perfect
city
probably
for
the
city
people
the
city
is
not
big
because
there
are
a
lot
bigger
than
it
was
such
as
Shanghai
Hangzhou
Nanjing
are
so
But
I
look
I
see
it
is
because
I
have
no
contact
with
the
city
and
the
first
contact
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
novelty
I
felt
that
here
is
my
dream
of
heaven
D
s
first
got
out
of
the
car
I
have
to
get
off
the
streets
together
with
him
I
don't
know
what
this
is
what
Lane
Road
always
feel
in
the
alley
as
in
gossip
so
I
feel
I
can't
touch
the
North
East
and
touched
the
East
has
touched
the
north
deeply
he
was
puzzled
When
I
came
to
a
river
river
sides
erected
a
high-rise
blocks
I
always
thought
that
this
is
the
Fuchun
River
I
really
think
you
saw
the
Fuchun
River
I
was
a
sigh
and
said
the
Fuchun
River
does
not
have
such
a
river
I
didn't
necessarily
it
big
D's
said
this
is
not
the
Fuchun
River
but
an
amaranth
Pujiang
I
said
oh
It
is
my
illusion
Words
I
am
his
behind
but
when
we
are
at
the
crossroads
in
the
middle
turn
right
this
is
a
long
hill
road
Liuzhou
Road
building
is
bristly
and
let
me
feel
the
perfect
city
economy
is
thriving
and
prosperous
each
poineering
hardships
may
make
it
difficult
to
imagine
as
I
came
to
a
world
came
to
a
childhood
paradise
I
see
a
paradise
of
dream
in
my
nose
to
dazzle
along
the
road
of
hill
of
dragon
of
the
past
it
is
a
city
surrounded
by
people
in
and
out
of
the
mall
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
in
the
commercial
city
upstairs
to
write
the
Fuchun
River
commercial
city
it
seems
like
I
know
this
is
F
the
city's
most
bustling
shopping
center
the
most
bustling
sidewalks
I
just
want
to
say
the
city
of
F
F
really
great
I
came
to
this
strange
city
I
really
feel
in
this
strange
city
I
can
absorb
your
sunny
temperament
to
be
a
city
that
the
giants
I
am
going
to
show
themselves
When
I
didn't
see
enough
outside
downtown
scene
I
was
D's
to
the
commercial
city
there
are
all
the
stalls
food
stands
above
the
green
vegetables
eggplant
garlic
onion
bean
curd
a
kind
sister
church
where
D's
stall
led
me
here
and
sister
chatted
a
while
when
the
elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
is
to
eat
lunch
saw
us
big
brother
put
down
his
chopsticks
call
us
to
sit
down
then
O
O
said
A
Cheng
Your
dinner
have
you
had
dinner
yet
I
haven't
answered
D's
for
I
said
we
have
no
Big
brother
says
here
to
eat
not
home
to
burn
She
also
said
yes
Or
here
to
eat
even
home
to
burn
much
trouble
D's
said
not
so
polite
home
to
burn
it
it
didn't
take
long
very
fast
He
made
the
remarks
at
the
same
time
I
still
look
around
because
I
see
here
is
such
a
big
stall
is
also
the
first
time
saw
so
many
dishes
people
buy
vegetable
stall
So
my
curiosity
in
here
is
not
fun
When
I
put
the
spirit
are
concentrated
in
the
food
stalls
of
things
he
finished
on
the
go
I'm
still
hazy
a
bit
at
a
loss
situation
he
said
to
me
A
Cheng
we
go
I
didn't
hear
there
is
one
point
be
absent-minded
look
he
coaxed
out
of
said
hello
What's
on
your
mind
Told
you
so
loudly
did
not
hear
Go
I
said
oh
Elder
sister
and
elder
sister
husband
to
pick
some
fresh
vegetables

you
bring
us
back
to
cook
he
and
I
left
sister
they
couple
booth
then
to
another
butcher
shop
stall
bought
several
kilograms
of
meat
left
the
commercial
city
and
imperceptibly
and
through
a
Malaysian
Road
came
to
a
named
Zhou
Jianong
lane
across
the
alley
alley
went
to
D's
house
D's
house
is
an
underground
garage
inside
a
very
the
smell
is
also
important
I
very
want
to
move
out
but
I
will
not
economic
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
environment
here
it
is
the
parents
of
thousand
exhort
enjoin
let
I
firmly
remember
them
you
want
me
to
listen
to
D's
so
I
had
to
reluctantly
stay
When
I
walked
inside
the
heat
from
the
outside
directly
to
heaven
so
I
really
feel
it's
hard
I
am
afraid
went
into
the
furnace
of
the
house
let
me
really
angry
be
ashamed
of
dying
When
I
was
in
the
hot
sun
dried
by
the
sun
at
the
same
time
D's
said
why
don't
you
come
in
Quickly
Wash
dishes
I
went
to
go
say
to
him
it
is
too
hot
I
have
a
bit
of
a
bear
D's
continued
hot
A
fan
Do
not
be
afraid
of
heat
a
long
time
to
get
over
I
come
too
but
we
insist
on
the
stand
A
man
should
be
afraid
of
tired
we
are
so
out
of
practice
I
said
oh
Came
to
give
him
food
finished
lunch
he's
out
let
me
have
a
rest
at
home
for
a
day
starting

I
promised
D's
a
boring
also
have
a
look
at
the
room
television
occasionally
to
bring
home
the
story
books
doubled
the
old
warm
up
in
primary
and
secondary
schools
the
residual
reading
difficulty
One
day
in
the
imperceptibly
in
the
past
soon
arrived
at
dusk
D's
also
returned
to
cook
I
don't
know
how

cook
so
there

person
to
complete
I
can
only

At
night
after

I
had
to

program
I
watched

Suddenly

Said

Put
out
the

then
we
sleep
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
sleep
at

because
the

also
very
difficult
to
eliminate
unless
the

Wake
up

me
as

for
at
that

I
feel
so
blessed
and
now
I
can
only

I
came

I

This
is

I

to

it
My
first
day
at

is
to
carry

or
sandbags
or
timber
is
to
carry
me
in
fact
living
very
tired
let
me
have
a
little
too
much
I
want
to
go
home
leaving
walking
back
but
I'm
penniless
did
not
know
how
to
go
home
D's
in
order
to
prevent
my
run
home
so
before
coming
he
will
try
various
devices
to
let
my
parents
didn't
give
me
money
but
now
I
know
already
too
late
for
regrets
I
sighed
deeply
said
hey
But
But
ah
Is
really
helpless
I
really
feel
cheated
like
that
there
is
a
stuttering
without
resistance
The
first
day
I
was
tired
legs
pumping
by
the
spirit
let
me
very
tired
To
the
very
next
day
morning
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
is
D
s
wake
me
from
this
dream
urged
me
to
go
to
work
I
mistily

to
get
up
go
to
work
work
on
the
path
of
two
feet
in
a
fall
while
walking
a
stumble
there
seems
to
be
a
little
be
petrified

How

I
not

Seems
to
me

more
magnificent

Also
praise
not
over
your
beauty
Even
though
more
beautiful
songs
Also
not
enough
for
you
to
sing
Still
heard
You
took
me
by
the
hand
Teach
me
how
to
walk

Beat

Still
remember
You
eagerly
looking
at
me
Teach
me

I
learned
to

in

river
The
first

How
many
times
I
cry
late
into
the
night
You
tirelessly
to
coax
me
Until
I
quietly
fall
asleep
But
your
eyes
bloodshot
And
hoarse
voice
How
many
times
you
waiting
by
my
bed
Only

But
regardless
of

Also
regardless
of
long
time
bending
over
the
tired
Favorite

Is
the
Chinese
characters
you
taught
At
that
time
you
hold
my
hand
with
the
pencil
Flat
and
vertical
dignified
and
imposing
You
said
that
a
man
have
to
like
it
Young
i
was
not
sensible
Occasionally
make
a
mistake
You
taught
me
the
force
of
justice
I
keep
in
mind
your
word
Dare
not
have
a
bit
slight
In
order
to
build
a
quiet
environment
for
my
studies
The
already
heavy
burden
of
the
family
You
take
on
all
the
housework
and
farm
work
Even
if
was
too
tired
to
take
a
breath
Also
won't
let
me
take
part
in
I
was
moved
to
nothing
to

In
my
memory
You've
never

You

What

On

All

Only

In

on

on
with
the
coffee
holding

the

They
be
in

to
depart
put
me
off
like

Occasionally
someone
stopped

at
me
I

Guo
Jingming
said
my
friends
are
my
courage
to
live
and
they
give
me
your
ability
let
me
face
this
world
no
longer
panic
Those
who
have
and
be
crazy
with
me
with
sadness
with
cycling
through
the
thin
youth
friend
I
think
we
all
remember
the
youth
is
how
we
face
cannot
erase
the
traces

her
phone
call
she
received
the
text
message
she
always
likes
to
write
very
long
As
it
was
she
knew
I
was
a
very
insecure
afraid
to
lose
even
if
there
is
no
important
will
also
write
a
long
message
let
me
know
her
by
my
side
never
leave
Chen
is
a
very
clever
girl
but
in
the
study
does
not
enlighten
after
each
test
there
will
always
be
that

my
front

a
begged
me
to
help
her
with
We
have
been
together
for
9
years
so
only
a
piece
of
memory
I
always
thought
she
was
a
bright
child
happy
and
simple
life
in
the
sun
quiet
and
stand
aloof
from
worldly
success
In
the
impression
after
graduating
on
the
third
her
father
let
her
choose
is
to
continue
to
class
or
leave
a
person
to
work
she
was
very
firm
very
decisive
I
can't
do
that
she
was
so
simply
even
want
to
go
to
the
airport
to
see
she
hesitated
for
a
long
time
Walk
that
day
is
Sunday
she
said
that
too
many
people
do
not
go
with
me
but
also
to
see
each
other
again
and
again
the
tears
I
actually
didn't
go
I
know
she
want
me
to
I
would
like
to
but
I
do
not
know
why
I'm
afraid
a
very
strange
feeling
still
remember
the
day
when
I
bent
over
the
window
watching
a
plane
fly
over
the
plane
I
think
in
the
heart
She
is
a
happy
live
But
I
can't
But
as
time
goes
by
We
all
grew
up
initially
that
a
simple
smile
child
now
has
a
cold
beautiful
face
Someone
close
to
him
he
will
have
to
leave
If
you
want
to
remember
something
you
must
forget
about
other
things
We
will
in
a
very
long
time
exclamation
lady-in-waiting
plaint
oneself
once
so
very
touching
How
time
so
fleeting
A
turn
you
care
about
and
you
are
left
Leaving
only
the
fluent
and
pure
memory
I
can
feel
your
tears
In
between
the
lines
In
the
midst
of
the
night
Underneath
the
moonlight
I
can
hear
you
cry
With
your
swollen
eyes
A
memory
so
painful
That
haunts
your
mind
I
can
hear
your
heart
Pounding
with
all
the
stride
I
know
you'll
be
strong
And
will
never
say
die
Protect
you
I
shall
With
all
my
might
Let
me
take
you
in
my
arms
And
together
we'll
fly
Through
storms
and
thunder
We
shall
survive
Together
hand
in
hand
We
shall
strive
Spreading
my
wings
I'll
be
there
for
you
all
my
life
With
no
fear
let
us
ride
To
the
bright
blue
sky
If
the
rays
from
the
sun
Seems
too
bright
Let
my
love
shelter
you
From
the
bright
sunlight
If
the
rain
from
the
cloud
Break
your
pride
Think
of
my
love
for
you
And
everything
shall
be
fine
Let
us
soar
let
us
fly
To
the
highest
height
And
everything
shall
be
fineLast
year
the
cancer
nearly
finished
me
off
However
with
the
accompaniment
of
my
best
friend
Candice
I
could
eventually
get
through
these
tough
time
Sometimes
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
always
stand
by
my
side
Last
summer
the
doctor
discovered
that
I
suffered
from
lung
cancer
At
that
moment
I
was
completely
shocked
All
memories
that
I
have
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
in
seconds
I
thought
I
was
going
to
leave
all
my
friends
my
family
and
all
people
I
loved
To
me
the
whole
world
was
just
sinking
Luckily
that
was
just
in
an
early
stage
and
the
doctor
said
that
I
had
I
great
chance
to
recover
after
a
series
of
treatments
But
he
warned
me
that
the
treatment
would
be
very
tough
and
painful
At
first
I
have
considered
to
refuse
the
treatment
However
after
I
have
though
about
all
of
my
valuable
friends
and
my
mom
and
dad
I
chose
to
take
the
chance
During
the
treatment
I
gradually
suffered
from
the
side
effects
The
number
of
hairs
on
my
head
declined
and
I
vomited
from
dawn
till
night
on
every
single
day
I
had
a
very
poor
appetite
and
I
nearly
had
no
desired
to
put
any
food
to
my
mouth
I
was
very
painful
and
I
was
thinking
about
giving
up
the
treatment
I
though
I
could
not
tolerate
it
anymore
However
with
the
support
and
encouragement
from
my
best
friend
Candice
I
have
eventually
made
it
through
the
rain
and
stand
up
once
again
Finally
I
recovered
One
summer
night
Candice
came
to
the
hospital
to
visit
me
We
sat
on
the
bench
that
facing
the
sea
The
sun
was
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
night
descended
We
chatted
underneath
the
stars
We
have
not
met
each
other
since
the
graduation
Candice
said
with
tears
on
her
face
Yes
I
have
never
thought
we
would
have
the
reunion
in
the
situation
I
said
She
kept
silent
with
her
tears
in
the
warm
gentle
breeze
We
have
been
best
friends
since
we
were
small
I
do
not
want
this
friendship
to
end
up
so
soon
She
cried
desperately
Zach
you
are
a
man
You
are
a
man
who
is
courageous
and
adventurous
You
should
have
that
guts
to
fight
for
your
life
and
people
around
you
But
Now
I
am
going
to
give
you
the
courage
you
need
She
lay
her
hand
on
me
Lord
please
give
this
little
boy
love
and
hope
to
face
the
obstacle
that
he
is
now
facing
Please
give
him
courage
to
help
him
to
find
the
way
Now
you
have
already
possessed
the
ability
to
fight
this
war
You
should
never
give
up
as
there
is
a
light
in
your
heart
and
shines
very
brightly
Since
them
I
understand
that
when
fate
is
tough
just
toughen
your
faith
With
a
smile
I
know
I
could
face
the
future
no
matter
what
lay
ahead
And
there's
a
hero
comes
along
with
the
strength
to
carry
on
My
dad
has
always
used
this
song
to
encourage
me
Until
he
passed
away
I
still
keep
this
song
in
my
iPod
and
listen
to
it
when
I
need
to
get
through
some
tough
time
To
me
this
song
does
not
only
symbolize
the
spirit
of
my
dad
but
also
mine
This
song
is
ubiquitous
in
various
singing
competitions
Regardless
of
its
singing
technique
the
beautiful
melody
and
those
meaningful
lyrics
has
helped
many
people
to
get
through
obstacles
This
fabulous
song
was
composed
by
American
singer-songwriter
Mariah
Carey
in
1993
and
definitely
performed
by
herself
The
song
mentioned
that
among
every
single
one
of
us
a
hero
lies
inside
our
heart
If
we
try
to
reach
into
our
soul
our
emptiness
will
disappear
There's
a
hero
if
you
look
inside
your
heart
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid
of
who
you
are
When
I
was
small
I
was
a
child
who
was
so
fragile
and
cried
easily
I
was
afraid
of
everything
I
was
so
this
and
small
and
when
my
classmates
bullied
me
all
I
would
do
was
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
and
cry
from
dawn
till
night
Worse
still
I
was
poor
in
academic
result
and
no
teachers
loved
me
On
these
days
I
found
myself
useless
and
believed
that
no
one
in
this
world
would
recognise
this
small
potato
I
was
so
desperate
Yet
in
one
dark
night
my
dad
knocked
on
my
door
and
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
hand
was
so
large
and
warm
All
I
could
feel
was
the
love
and
hope
transmitted
through
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
and
to
my
heart
and
soul
Son
you
should
not
be
fragile
anymore
But
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
Now
I
am
going
to
recall
your
hero
from
your
soul
and
from
now
on
you
would
never
feel
lonely
anymore
My
hero
and
your
hero
have
already
stayed
together
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
Other
people
can
say
anything
they
want
to
say
Although
they
try
to
bring
you
down
you
will
never
allow
them
to
do
so
because
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
This
hero
will
always
stay
close
to
you
and
protect
you
forever
Afterwards
he
sang
this
song
to
me
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow
But
don't
let
anyone
to
tear
them
away
Since
then
whenever
I
need
to
face
any
problems
or
obstacles
alone
I
will
not
be
fragile
anymore
All
I
need
to
do
is
sing
Hero
along
with
my
hero
and
my
father's
hero
and
I
will
certainly
know
that
my
father
will
guide
me
where
I
should
go
I
know
that
there
is
a
light
in
me
and
shines
very
brightly
and
other
people
can
try
but
they
can
never
take
that
away
from
me
The
meeting
is
WangHai
Time
always
unknowingly
hurried
away
flash
Also
in
the
online
to
spend
a
few
years
Cry
also
laughed
Thousands
of
day
and
night
WangHai
roaming
A
thought
to
mature
Walk
to
the
friend
go
to
How
many
friends
already
not
disappear
Sitting
alone
in
the
space
is
cold
and
cheerless
Some
vague
sad
loss
Thankfully
Have
a
lot
of
friends
have
been
silent
about
Accompany
me
along
the
way
Always
buchibuqi
In
the
virtual
network
Deduce
true
feelings
Behind
the
screen
in
the
cold
And
each
wish
Whenever
the
birthday
Will
receive
blessings
of
friends
Very
often
I
moved
ShiXi
unceasingly
Thanks
friends
gifts
and
blessing
Because
of
you
Lonely
night
has
not
lonely
Because
of
you
My
birthday
is
not
cold
and
cheerless
Of
a
friend
said
I
am
not
alone
My
friend
Thousands
of
WanLiLi
just
a
moment
of
distance
Don't
need
name
also
need
not
face
Both
you
and
I
Thank
you
all

in
front

your
friends
When

by
saying

business
When

like

When

When

deeply
she

you
You
thanked

moving
halfway
across
the
country
When

baby

really
busy
right
now
When

she
fell
ill
and
needed
you
to
take
care
of
her
You
thanked
her
by
reading
about
the
burden
parents
become
to
their
children
And
then
one
day
she
quietly
died
And
everything
you
never
did
came
crashing
down
like
thunder
Rock
me
baby
rock
me
all
night
long
The
hand
who
rocks
the
cradle...may
rock
the
world
Let
us
take
a
moment
of
the
time
just
to
pay
tribute
and
show
appreciation
to
the
person
called
mom
though
some
may
not
say
it
openly
to
their
mother
There's
no
substitute
for
her
Cherish
every
single
moment
Though
at
times
she
may
not
be
the
best
of
friends
may
not
agree
to
our
thoughts
she
is
still
your
mother!!!She
will
be
there
for
you...to
listen
to
your
woes
your
braggings
your
frustations
etc
Ask
yourself...have
you
put
aside
enough
time
for
her
to
listen
to
her
blues
of
working
in
the
kitchen
her
tiredness
Be
tactful
loving
and
still
show
her
due
respect
though
you
may
have
a
different
view
from
hers
Once
gone
only
fond
memories
of
the
past
and
also
regrets
will
be
left
Thomas
Carlyle
lived
from
1795
until
1881
He
was
a
10000
wow
gold
Scot
essayist
and
historian
During
his
lifetime
he
became
one
of
the
world's
greatest
writers
But
he
was
a
human
and
storage
rack

On
October

1826
wow

Carlyle
married
his
secretary
Jane
Welsh
She
was
an
intelligent
attractive
and
somewhat
temperamental
daughter
of
a
well-to-do
doctor
They
had
their
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
but
still
loved
Bathroom
Vanities
each
other
dearly
After
their
marriage
Jane
continued
to
serve
as
his
secretary
But
after
several
years
of
marriage
Jane
became
ill
Being
Bathroom
Mirrors
a
hard
worker
Carlyle
became
so
absorbed
in
his
writings
that
he
let
Jane
continue
working
for
several
weeks
after
she
became
ill
She
had
cancer
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
slow
growing
kind
she
finally
became
confined
to
her
bed
Although
Carlyle
loved
her
Bathroom
Accessories
dearly
he
very
seldom
found
time
to
stay
with
her
long
He
was
busy
with
his
work
when
Jane
died
they
carried
her
to
the
cemetery
for
the
service
The
day
Glass
Basin
was
a
miserable
day
It
was
raining
hard
and
the
mud
was
deep
Following
the
funeral
Carlyle
went
back
to
his
home
He
was
taking
it
pretty
hard
He
went
up
the
stairs
to
Jane's
room
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
her
bed
He
sat
there
thinking
Shower
Enclosures
about
how
little
time
he
had
spent
with
her
and
wishing
so
much
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
differently
Noticing
her
diary
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
picked
it
up
and
began
to
steel
shelving
read
it
Suddenly
he
seemed
shocked
He
saw
it
There
on
one
page
she
had
written
Interior
Doors
a
single
line
Yesterday
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
and
it
was
like
heaven
I
love
him
so
Something
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
He
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
that
he
meant
so
much
to
her
He
thought
of
all
wow
gold
australia
the
times
he
had
gone
about
his
work
without
thinking
about
and
noticing
her
Then
Carlyle
turned
the
page
in
the
diary
There
he
noticed
she
racking
had
written
some
words
that
broke
his
heart
I
have
listened
all
day
to
hear
his
steps
in
the
hall
but
now
it
is
late
and
I
guess
he
won't
come
today
Carlyle
read
a
little
more
in
the
book
Then
he
threw
it
down
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Some
of
his
friends
found
him
at
the
grave
his
buy
wow
gold
australia
face
buried
in
the
mud
His
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
Tears
continued
to
roll
down
his
cheeks
He
kept
repeating
over
and
over
again
If
I
had
only
known
if
I
had
only
known
But
it
was
too
late
for
Carlyle
She
was
dead
After
Jane's
death
Carlyle
made
world
of
warcraft
gold
for
sale
little
attempt
to
write
again
The
historians
say
he
lived
another
15
years
weary
bored
and
a
partial
recluse
I
share
the
story
with
in
the
hope
that
you
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
While
our
loved
ones
must
have
the
money
we
make
to
live
it
is
the
love
we
have
that
they
really
want
Give
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
It
is
not
easy
to
define
what
kind
of
meaning
to
the
enterprise
culture
because
the
enterpise
culture
stems
from
the
ration
and
reality
which
should
be
related
to
the
regulations
or
how
to
react
to
the
risk
of
management
or
market
instead
of
just
focusing
on
training
and
meeting
which
should
be
related
to
the
proportion
of
thoughts
of
belonging
to
our
company
and
benefitting
our
company
in
the
difficulty
Sometimes
the
puzzled
people
are
always
in
the
mess
of
understanding
of
why
the
itemized
regulations
could
not
optimize
the
operation
and
not
regulate
the
action
of
some
officials
who
always
abused
the
power
to
benefit
themselves
which
lead
to
the
argument
that
as
long
as
the
company
is
so
large
that
the
culture
of
enterprise
is
absolutly
difficult
to
be
built
up
Different
people
with
different
education
background
and
different
comprehension
of
society
would
not
be
integrated
to
the
common
recognition
of
enterprise
culture
which
is
the
crux
to
help
the
company
be
prosperous
In
spite
of
training
many
officials
there
are
lots
of
bottlenecks
which
should
be
smoothed
and
holes
which
should
be
covered
so
we
must
work
out
some
measures
to
make
our
company
step
on
the
right
road
Regulations
are
parts
of
the
enterprise
culture
making
the
road
straight
but
what
kind
of
regulations
are
suitful
to
the
state-owned
company
The
regulation
are
always
eroded
by
dereliction
and
are
not
always
strickly
implemented
by
some
departments
Frankly
speaking
the
enterprise
culture
is
just
having
some
aspects
in
consciousness
frequently
dominating
the
behavior
which
would
give
us
some
reference
on
how
to
enact
the
detailed
regulations
could
get
the
return
as
expected
The
most
important
thing
related
to
the
enterprise
culture
is
how
to
strengthen
the
consciousness
in
the
every
respect
of
operation
We
must
detail
every
process
of
how
to
control
the
cost
and
how
to
make
the
work
efficient
and
rational
If
employee
could
make
their
regulations
rooted
in
mind
they
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
keep
them
from
dereliction
and
would
try
their
best
to
devote
the
wisdom
to
benifitting
our
company.For
example
The
flaws
in
human
nature
and
the
shortage
of
wealth
would
seduce
the
officals
to
accept
the
secret
money
from
agencies
who
are
intended
to
pull
down
the
officals
by
all
kinds
of
tactics
and
if
the
officals
are
too
fragile
to
resist
the
gifts
they
would
be
united
with
agencies
to
cheat
our
company
so
the
task
which
brooks
no
delay
is
the
education
brainwashing
and
making
the
severe
punishment
happen
without
them
the
enterprise
culture
is
like
the
moon
in
water
like
the
flowers
in
mist
like
the
stupid
being
called
clever
What
is
the
quintessence
of
the
enterprise
culture
It
is
easy
or
it
is
difficult
to
make
a
conclusion
because
it
is
a
hard
job
to
change
people¡¯s
mindset
which
is
always
in
the
prejustice.So
at
first
we
must
scrutinize
the
origin
of
the
prejustice
why
are
so
many
people
always
just
negating
others
because
we
are
extremely
lack
of
communication
to
understand
with
each
other
lacking
of
wisdom
to
tell
the
right
and
the
wrong
lacking
of
the
wide
chest
to
tolerate
the
different
ideas
wnich
lead
to
misunderstand
among
people
and
to
form
the
impasse
to
flexibly
resolve
the
thorny
problem.There
are
some
words
similar
and
implicated
with
the
word
culture
in
dictionary
such
as
communication
concoct
cooperation
coordination
copartner
control¡±
giving
us
some
metaphor
or
euphemism
that
enterprise
culture
must
depend
on
the
communication
cooperation
must
control
the
ridiculous
behavior
of
some
officials
must
concoct
the
atmosphere
from
stiff
suffocated
environment
to
the
active
creative
philosophical
philanthropic
state
of
mindset
of
everyone.But
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
behavior
spontaneously
follow
the
bright
side
of
human
being
just
because
of
the
fragile
and
selfish
nature
of
people
with
some
ignorant
knowledge
about
themselves
so
using
the
regulations
to
control
the
devil
in
their
mindset
and
encouraging
the
bold
attitude
to
resolve
the
present
and
history
problem
is
the
essential
way
of
making
the
enterprise
culture
alive
and
giving
the
light
to
the
employee
We
must
change
the
thoughts
that
we
are
isolated
by
others
we
are
just
living
for
ourself
we
are
just
focusing
on
our
private
cases
to
the
thoughts
that
if
we
can
help
each
other
if
we
believe
in
the
philosophy
of
strengthenning
the
consciousness
of
doing
the
job
positively
and
wisely
getting
good
return
we
can
achieve
the
goal
of
making
our
company
profitful
and
competitive
even
making
our
life
happy
Why
are
the
employee
always
having
no
enthusiasm
and
lacking
of
a
little
responsibility
in
their
job?why
are
there
lots
of
complaint
in
our
company?why
are
the
talented
people
resigning
quickly
from
our
company?Yes
the
salary
is
the
key
and
having
no
feeling
in
cooperation
unity
belonging
and
having
not
the
promising
future
are
the
fundamental
reasons
which
steamrollerred
the
spirit
to
be
loyal
to
company
so
putting
the
importance
of
employee
in
priority
is
the
way
of
having
the
high
competition
in
this
globallized
world
A
healthy
company
is
the
one
that
urgently
need
the
creative
advices
from
employee
in
stead
of
closing
their
eyes
filling
in
their
ears
in
front
of
the
employee
who
may
have
some
profound
and
pragmatic
ideas
which
maybe
benifit
to
the
operation
of
our
company.But
how
to
distinguish
the
good
ideas
or
the
wrong
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
leaders
who
must
look
through
everything
including
themselves
and
others
adding
that
they
must
comprehend
the
logic
of
mindset
and
behavior
of
themself
To
be
leaders
the
open
attitude
is
the
good
way
to
rationalize
the
management
adopting
the
positive
way
to
eliminate
the
flaws
in
the
structure
and
to
attain
the
goal
with
attacking
the
black
hands¡±
instead
of
always
being
in
defensive
measure
of
healing
the
fissure
in
management
that
is
deficient
in
courage
and
wisdom.It
is
also
one
part
of
the
enterprise
culture.Frankly
saying
having
good
return
to
our
company
is
dominated
by
the
fate
by
the
hearts
of
all
employee
by
the
regulations
by
the
rational
philosophy
by
the
authentic
wisdom
Service
is
the
culture
it
sounds
like
simple
but
complicated
and
profound
if
you
want
to
make
it
better
and
better
How
to
do
service
is
the
important
culture
of
enterprise
which
could
attract
many
people
to
take
our
flights
again
and
again.We
can
ask
a
simple
question
that
if
you
look
up
to
see
the
twinkled
stars
in
night
what
make
you
comfortable?The
answer
is
easy
the
bright
the
color
make
you
feel
comfortable
which
can
make
us
have
some
comprehension
that
if
you
make
people¡¯s
body
such
as
eye
ear
limbs
nose
heart
feel
nice
your
service
is
the
nice
service
if
you
make
the
customers
angry
you
failed
in
doing
service.So
you
must
think
over
how
to
make
the
customers
feel
better
is
the
best
way
to
learn
how
to
give
service
to
these
arrogant
and
hypercritical
customers
Above
all
We
can
understand
that
if
you
have
regulations
in
your
mindset
which
sometimes
is
selfish
and
Out
of
my
window
the
darkness
gave
me
a
signal:if
you
are
habitted
in
the
darkness
of
heart
you
would
be
dissappionted
for
ever.sometimes
I
want
to
find
the
way
of
making
me
in
the
positive
attitude
to
the
life
but
always
are
beated
by
my
experiences
which
cutted
off
the
robe
attached
to
the
sunshine.but
the
frustrated
happenning
is
not
the
domination
which
converts
my
good
intention
to
the
devil
the
domination
is
my
thoughts
which
are
sometimes
not
superficial
but
profound
gives
me
the
light
and
warm
to
live
simply
and
happily
What
kind
of
thoughts
would
release
my
pressure
and
gives
me
the
ability
to
survive
in
the
chilly
and
choppy
reality
which
would
distort
the
heart
fragile
to
the
fragmentary
condition
or
make
the
heart
wisom
strong
get
the
meaning
of
life
which
would
push
me
to
the
heaven
with
lots
of
beauty
and
full
I
would
say
that
my
thoughts
is
related
to
the
thoughts
themselves
if
you
can
change
the
thoughts
quickly
and
correctedly
you
would
be
on
the
right
trace
to
pusure
the
objects
you
want;if
you
are
stubborn
enough
you
would
be
easily
defeated
by
the
fate
which
urgently
need
the
wisdom
light
to
cover
the
black
in
the
mindset
full
of
good
and
evil
When
I
was
a
child
I
do
not
know
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
and
have
no
faith
which
would
comfort
my
soul
to
give
me
a
light
would
direct
my
road
to
the
tranquillized
home
My
pressure
is
from
my
family
where
my
father
is
not
a
reasonable
person
and
had
no
ideas
on
how
to
cultivate
my
individual
personality
and
my
character
so
in
the
long
time
I
felt
the
life
of
mine
is
in
hell
even
if
I
have
food
to
eat
have
cloth
to
wear
but
my
heart
was
in
deep
frustration
and
had
much
hatre
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
shaping
my
thoughts
that
the
life
had
not
power
to
lift
me
from
the
miserable
conditions.after
long
long
time
the
climate
has
been
changed
to
more
warm
the
rivers
have
been
changed
to
more
polluted
the
hearts
of
many
people
have
been
changed
by
desire
for
money
to
be
vicious
my
god
has
given
me
the
enlight
that
if
you
can
comprehend
the
love
the
truth
you
can
have
sheft
below
the
sunshine
which
would
fill
you
and
warm
you
so
it
is
my
fortunation
I
can
get
the
hints
from
god
giving
me
the
truth
which
fattened
my
twisted
raods
in
the
mist
and
I
can
smile
happily
and
never
be
frustrated
again
Even
if
I
explain
the
understanding
of
love
and
truth
again
and
again
lots
of
people
still
had
lof
of
question
on
my
comprehension
about
the
thoughts
as
same
as
my
past.in
my
past
I
was
puzzled
intensifiedly
on
some
meaningful
words.some
people
said
to
me
the
words
wisdom
but
it
is
like
a
fool
who
can
not
distinguish
what
is
right
or
wrong
I
am
delayed
to
understand
the
truth
which
stumbled
my
existence
and
made
me
fall
to
hell.but
the
darkness
is
not
always
having
no
light
maybe
my
god
has
pity
on
me
one
day
I
found
thoughts
can
change
my
action
my
attitude
to
the
life
I
confronted
that
is
in
the
embarrassed
condition.after
I
have
been
changed
to
the
peace
life
by
the
fresh
way
of
thinking
I
can
in
confidence
make
a
conclusion
that
please
believing
in
the
god¡¯s
soul
that
tell
you
what
is
yours
what
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
this
world
worthy
pusuring
you
should
love
should
dent
the
suffering
you
have
got
and
smiling
in
the
darkness
stubborn
and
everyone
would
follow
the
regulations
rooted
in
your
heart
thinking
of
the
company
as
your
own
our
enterprise
would
be
promising.The
safety
and
service
is
the
crux
to
our
enterprise
we
must
strengthen
our
consciousness
to
keep
them
in
our
mind
and
do
our
best
to
support
it
VIRTUE
is
like
a
rich
stone
best
plain
set
and
surely
virtue
is
best
in
a
body
that
is
comely
though
not
of
delicate
features
and
that
hath
rather
dignity
of
presence
than
beauty
of
aspect
Neither
is
it
almost
seen
that
very
beautiful
persons
are
otherwise
of
great
virtue
as
if
nature
were
rather
busy
not
to
err
than
in
labor
to
produce
excellency
And
therefore
they
prove
accomplished
but
not
of
great
spirit
and
study
rather
behavior
than
virtue
But
this
holds
not
always
for
Augustus
Caesar
Titus
Vespasianus
Philip
le
Belle
of
France
Edward
the
Fourth
of
England
Alcibiades
of
Athens
Ismael
the
Sophy
of
Persia
were
all
high
and
great
spirits
and
yet
the
most
beautiful
men
of
their
times
In
beauty
that
of
favor
is
more
than
that
of
color
and
that
of
decent
and
gracious
motion
more
than
that
of
favor
That
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
cannot
express
no
nor
the
first
sight
of
the
life
There
is
no
excellent
beauty
that
hath
not
some
strangeness
in
the
proportion
A
man
cannot
tell
whether
Apelles
or
Albert
Durer
were
the
more
trifler
whereof
the
one
would
make
a
personage
by
geometrical
proportions
the
other
by
taking
the
best
parts
out
of
divers
faces
to
make
one
excellent
Such
personages
I
think
would
please
nobody
but
the
painter
that
made
them
Not
but
I
think
a
painter
may
make
a
better
face
than
ever
was
but
he
must
do
it
by
a
kind
of
felicity
as
a
musician
that
maketh
an
excellent
air
in
music
and
not
by
rule
A
man
shall
see
faces
that
if
you
examine
them
part
by
part
you
shall
find
never
a
good
and
yet
altogether
do
well
If
it
be
true
that
the
principal
part
of
beauty
is
in
decent
motion
certainly
it
is
no
marvel
though
persons
in
years
seem
many
times
more
amiable
pulchrorum
autumnus
pulcher
for
no
youth
can
be
comely
but
by
pardon
and
considering
the
youth
as
to
make
up
the
comeliness
Beauty
is
as
summer
fruits
which
are
easy
to
corrupt
and
cannot
last
and
for
the
most
part
it
makes
a
dissolute
youth
and
an
age
a
little
out
of
countenance
but
yet
certainly
again
if
it
light
well
it
maketh
virtue
shine
and
vices
blush
first
memory
I
have
of
him
of
anything
really
is
his
strength
It
was
in
the
late
afternoon
in
a
house
under
construction
near
ours
The
unfinished
wood
floor
had
large
terrifying
holes
whose
yawning
darkness
I
knew
led
to
nowhere
good
His
powerful
hands
then
age
33
wrapped
all
the
way
around
my
tiny
arms
then
age
4
and
easily
swung
me
up
to
his
shoulders
to
command
all
I
surveyed
The
relationship
between
a
son
and
his
father
changes
over
time
It
may
grow
and
flourish
in
mutual
maturity
It
may
sour
in
resented
dependence
or
independence
With
many
children
living
in
single-parent
homes
today
it
may
not
even
exist
But
to
a
little
boy
right
after
World
War
II
a
father
seemed
a
god
with
strange
strengths
and
uncanny
powers
enabling
him
to
do
and
know
things
that
no
mortal
could
do
or
know
Amazing
things
like
putting
a
bicycle
chain
back
on
just
like
that
Or
building
a
hamster
cage.Or
guiding
a
jigsaw
so
it
forms
the
letter
F;I
learned
the
alphabet
that
way
in
those
pre-television
days
There
were
of
course
rules
to
learn
First
came
the
handshake
None
of
those
fishy
little
finger
grips
but
a
good
firm
squeeze
accompanied
by
an
equally
strong
gaze
into
the
other's
eyes
The
first
thing
anyone
knows
about
you
is
your
handshake
he
would
say
And
we'd
practice
it
each
night
on
his
return
from
work
the
serious
toddler
in
the
battered
Cleveland
Indian's
cap
running
up
to
the
giant
father
to
shake
hands
again
and
and
and
